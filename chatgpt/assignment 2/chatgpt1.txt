Είπες:
salting and encoding, if the database is not using any of those and instead stores password in plain text, what owasp 2021 and cwe vulnerability is it?
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Storing passwords in plain text without salting or encoding/hashing is a critical security vulnerability. This violates standard security practices and exposes users to severe risks if the database is compromised.

OWASP Top 10 (2021)
The relevant OWASP category is:

A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures

Storing passwords in plain text falls directly under this category because it demonstrates poor credential storage practices. OWASP highlights the use of strong credential storage mechanisms (e.g., hashed with a strong, slow algorithm like bcrypt, and salted) as a key protection.

Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
Several CWEs are applicable here, primarily:

CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials

This specifically refers to storing credentials (like passwords) in an unprotected form, such as plain text in a database.

CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information

This applies more generally to any sensitive data (including passwords) being stored in cleartext, whether in a file, DB, etc.

CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format

Refers to storing passwords in any format that can be reversed or read back, like plaintext or weakly encrypted forms.

Summary
Aspect	Value
OWASP 2021	A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures
CWE IDs	CWE-256, CWE-312, CWE-257
Recommended Fix:
Always hash passwords using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2), and salt them with a unique per-user salt. Never store raw or easily reversible passwords in your database.

Είπες:
isn't it A02:2021 Cryptographic Failures ? and which cwe?
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Excellent question — you're absolutely right to challenge the categorization, because password storage flaws overlap between A02:2021 (Cryptographic Failures) and A07:2021 (Identification and Authentication Failures) in OWASP 2021.

✅ Correct OWASP 2021 Category:
The most accurate and primary category for storing passwords in plaintext (i.e., no hashing, no salting) is:

🔐 A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures
This category focuses on failures related to cryptography — including lack of encryption, use of weak or no hashing for passwords, and storing sensitive data in plaintext.

OWASP’s official examples for A02:2021 include:
Storing passwords in plain text or with fast/insecure hashing algorithms (e.g., MD5).

Not using salting or key stretching (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt, PBKDF2, Argon2).

✅ Relevant CWEs:
When passwords are stored in plaintext (unsalted, unhashed), the most applicable CWEs are:

CWE ID	Name	Description
CWE-256	Unprotected Storage of Credentials	Refers to storing credentials in a form that is easily accessible, such as plaintext.
CWE-312	Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information	Applies generally to sensitive data, including passwords, stored in cleartext (e.g., in a database).
CWE-257	Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format	Refers to storing passwords in a way they can be read back or reversed (plaintext or encrypted instead of hashed).
✅ Final Answer
Aspect	Value
OWASP 2021	A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures
CWE IDs	CWE-256, CWE-312, CWE-257
These vulnerabilities are critical and directly reflect improper cryptographic storage of credentials — a violation of core security principles.

Το ChatGPT είπε:
Here is the updated and extended paragraph, now including a strong, well-integrated mention of Cloudflare and enhancements to the "Source Code Location" section:

🛡️ A03:2021 – Insecure Design
CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
The application lacks the ability to perform security controls to prevent or mitigate brute-force attacks. This mechanism should especially be implemented on the login functionality and in every sensitive request, to prevent credential stuffing and Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Mechanisms such as rate limiting, account lockouts after repeated failures, or CAPTCHA challenges are crucial to distinguish between automated bots and legitimate human users.

Use of Cloudflare is probably the most effective solution for this vulnerability, as it offers powerful edge-level protection against brute-force attacks, including WAF rules, rate limiting, bot detection, geo-blocking, and CAPTCHA enforcement — all of which occur before the request reaches the application layer. Cloudflare’s security rules can help prevent automated login attempts, throttle suspicious traffic, and act as a first line of defense against credential stuffing and brute-forcing tools like OWASP ZAP.

🔍 Source Code Location
Controller.LoginController.java:

At Line 32, the login() method performs direct user authentication without implementing any business logic to monitor or limit failed login attempts.

There is no IP-based throttling, no login rate limiting, no CAPTCHA, and no lockout mechanism, leaving the application open to online brute-force attacks.

Additionally, the login endpoint does not check for patterns of suspicious activity such as multiple failed attempts within a short time window from the same IP or device fingerprint.

No integration with upstream Web Application Firewalls (WAF) or rate-limiting tools is observed in the source code, nor are any Cloudflare-related headers or verification tokens validated server-side.

The application allows repeated credential attempts without delay or rejection, facilitating automated attacks.

🧪 Exploitation
Using tools like OWASP ZAP's fuzzer, along with known or predictable usernames and passwords, an attacker can send a high volume of login requests to the /login endpoint. As demonstrated in the CWE-798 scenario, the application processes these requests without introducing any delay, account lockout, or CAPTCHA challenge, allowing brute-force attacks to succeed.

how to erase from word some headers from being part of περιεχομενα
Το ChatGPT είπε:
To exclude specific headers from appearing in the Table of Contents ("Περιεχόμενα") in Microsoft Word, follow one of these precise methods depending on your needs:

✅ Method 1: Change the Heading Style to a Non-TOC Style
Word includes all text with styles like Heading 1, Heading 2, etc., in the Table of Contents by default.

To exclude:
Select the heading you want to exclude.

In the Home tab, under Styles, change its style to something not included in the TOC, such as:

Normal

Subtitle

Or create a custom style (see Method 3).

✅ Method 2: Use a Custom TOC Field
You can manually define which heading levels/styles are included in your Table of Contents.

Steps:
Place your cursor where you want the TOC.

Press Alt + F9 to reveal the TOC field code (if it's already inserted).

You’ll see something like:

{ TOC \o "1-3" \h \z \u }
Edit it to include only the levels you want.
For example:

{ TOC \o "1-2" }   → includes only Heading 1 and 2
Press Alt + F9 again to hide field codes.

Right-click on the TOC and choose Update Field > Update entire table.

✅ Method 3: Create a Custom Style for Excluded Headings
Select the heading text.

On the Home tab, click the arrow on Styles > Create a Style.

Name it something like MyHeading and ensure it's not based on Heading 1–9.

Click Modify, then uncheck "Add to TOC" (if using a third-party TOC plugin), or just make sure it doesn't use Heading 1–3.

Re-apply the TOC to exclude this custom style.

✅ Bonus: Use the “Hidden” Style for Stealth Removal
If you don’t want to change the style but just want to hide the heading from TOC, you can:

Select the heading.

Press Ctrl + Shift + H to apply the Hidden character format.

Update the TOC — the hidden text won’t appear in the TOC.

Let me know if you’re using Word in Greek or need help customizing the TOC field for Greek documents (e.g., keeping Περιεχόμενα as the title).

Vulnerabilities
The following vulnerabilities are identified in the present Shop application. They are presented in order of importance (from most critical to least critical), following the top 10 OWASP 20212 vulnerability categories that are published at https://owasp.org/Top10/ . Only those vulnerabilities that have also been exploited by the author of this assignment are being shown. 
A01:2021 Broken Access Control
CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Control Key
The application implements access control based on roles, and distinguishes between admin and customer. Admin functions like /delete/{id}, are strictly intended for users with admin role. Although again, error page is missing and attacker can exploit sensitive data, by deliberately making such authorization bypass requests.
 
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
BookController.java: Line: 94 (@DeleteMapping(“/delete/{id}”) public String deleteBook (@PathVariable Long id, HttpSession session)) includes an if (!"admin".equals(session.getAttribute("role"))). Method is annotated with @DeleteMapping, and expects an HTTP DELETE. Same admin check happens with save book and new book. This led to trying to execute the method, leaving space for potential backdoors or advanced exploitation (similarly to using advanced sql questions, but here we could use to view the error whitelabel error page). The appropriate annotation that should be applied on all admin control method is @PreAuthorize(“hasRole(‘ADMIN’)”). Also each controller method, should have implementing a BookNotFoundException.


EXPLOITATION
(Attempted: Although there was not a clear exploitation in a sense of bypassing, the results were not absolutely satisfying)
An attempt was made to exploit any vulnerability when using a use with lower privilege (e.g. a user jim/jim with JSESSIONID=555DBD6EA2B9812A27EFBCE7587EBCA7) to perform administrative action (like deleting an existing book with id 4) without authorization. The attempt was by using  POST /delete/{id}, including _method=delete in the body, that was previously been sent by an admin, but now with the user’s session id. This resulted in returning a Whitelabel error page, that was saying that method POST is not supported.
In general: hasRole(‘ADMIN’): Checks if the user has role name ADMIN.
@PreAuthorize: Is used to define an authorization expression before the method runs, if method is false, execution does not occur. It integrates into Spring requests lifecycle. When user sends a POST /delete , with JSESSIONID of a user, Spring security basically intercepts it, returning a 403 Forbidden response, instead of doing something like redirecting to login or to a Whitelabel error page.
CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute.
 
Application utilizes a JSESSIONID cookies for the session management. When observed in browser developer tools, this session cookie, did not define the SameSite attribute. This attribute works on new browsers to protect again Cross Site Request Forgery attacks when cookies are sent with cross site requests. Absense of this means that browser’s default behaviours will be used here, and this is less secure and also differently performed by one browser to another.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
server.servlet.session.cookie.same-site is missing from application.properties.
EXPLOITATION
Old browsers could send cross site requests to our application, with their session cookie. Unauthorized action can happen when no CSRF tokens are involved. This can happen when browser includes the JSESSIONID cookie in a cross-site content (e.g. we could use malicious_csrf.html webpage and have the same results).
 


A02:2021 Cryptographic Failures
CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
This application operates entirely on HTTP which is not encrypted (http://localhost:8080). HTTPS uses transport layer security providing security to the exchange of data between user and server. HTTP sends transmitted data on the network in plain text, such as usernames, passwords or even card credentials. Also the database has not TLS encryption too.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
application.properties: There is no server.ssl for client server communication, or useSSL= true (or REQUIRED), in the spring.datasource.url for database encryption.
EXPLOITATION
If an attacker is using the same network e.g. public Wi-Fi or router, with tools like OWASP ZAP or WhireShark, it is easy to exploit sensitive data in plain text. As shown in the picture below, login data are fully exposed. This causes severe exploitation of privacy, gives room for fraud transactions, or leak of sensitive information. Lack of database encryption is even a more severe vulnerability because database server itself can be compromised.
 
CWE-312: ClearText Storage of Sensitive Information
Although in application.properties we are not storing data, but rather creating new database tables each time,  spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = create, the customer passwords are stored in plain text in the database without any encoding or salting.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	model.User.java: The password field in Line 14, it is defined as String and in Line 23 there is no encryption or salting applied.
•	repository.UserRepository.java: The JpaRepository save method is not processing the password before saving it.
•	controller.RegistrationController.java: userRepository(user) saves the user details (including the password) in plain text on the database.
EXPLOITATION
If a user has access to the database, by sql injection or otherwise, there will be immediate access to the database plaintext information. This allows straightforward takeover of the account . The observation of registered user jim/jim directly from the database confirms this vulnerability.
 

A03:2021 Injection
CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Email Uniqueness)
The application fails to validate for unique email address provided during registration of a new customer. This allows distinct user account to be associated with same email, leading to violation of integrity of data.
 
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	controller.RegistrationController.java: The registerUser method (Line 26) only checks for the uniqueness of the username userRepository.findByUsername(use.getUsername()), but does not perform any validation to ensure if the email is unique, before saving the User in the database.
•	Repository.UserRepository.java: This interface is missing a method to find users by email, for example Optional<User> findByEmail(String email) for making the check.
EXPLOITATION
The attacker can register many accounts using the same email address, creating ambiguity when the user tries to identify, and also can cause problems when accounts tries to recover (e.g. password reset). The ability to successfully have registered as jim and jim2, and both use a@a.com demonstrates this lack of validity.
A04:2021 Insecure Design
CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Application lacks the ability to perform security controls to prevent or mitigate brute-force attacks. This mechanism should especially work on login functionality and in every request, to prevent DDOS. Mechanisms such as rate limiting , account locks after many failed attempts, or CAPTCHA challenges to determine if the client is driven by a robot or a human.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	Controller.LoginController.java: The login method at Line 32, makes authentication of the user, without making any checks for suspicious activity (e.g numbers of failed attempts from an IP within a certain interarrival time). This control is missing any business logic. 
This vulnerability is one of the hardest to solve, because there are too many ways to harm the servers. Use of Cloudfare is one of the most effective solutions for this vulnerability, it offers edge-level brute force attack protections. WAF rules, rate limiting, bot detection, geo-blocking and CAPTCHA are the most crucial and happen before the request reaches the application layer. For example, brute force tools of ZAP cannot can be blocked easily with Cloudfare.
EXPLOITATION
Combining ZAP fuzzer and known username/passwords or by brute forcing the session id cookie, we can send a large number of username/passwords to the /login. As demonstrated on the  CWE-798 picture of brute-force with the ZAP fuzzer (that we found a successful combination of role/username and password), the application processes the requests without any delays, account locks or CAPTCHA challenges. 

    
CWE-654: Reliance on a Single Factor Decision
This application relies only on a single authentication (user and password) for user login. There is no multi factor authentication implemented, so the authentication is based solely in one piece of evidence.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
Controller.LoginController.java: The login controller (Line 32) only validates username and password, without any concerns about secondary authentication factors.
 
EXPLOITATION
User accounts are highly vulnerable if credentials are stolen from phishing or brute force attacks (demonstrated on CWE-307 that with brute force we joined as admin). The attacker can impersonate to any unauthorized actions without any additional verification. 
A05:2021 Security Misconfiguration
CWE-756: Missing Error Page
 
“Book Sore Application” does not have neither error page, not any error page configuration. Thus, when error occurs (e.g. unsupported HTTP method used), then the Spring Boot default ‘Whitelabel Error Page’ is displayed. This page has sensitive information and provides details about the application structure and exact place of the failure.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
This vulnerability happens because there is no handling on application.properties file (e.g. server.error.whitelabel.enabled=false) and custom error views for example an error.html page, or a catholic exception handling like @ControllerAdvice class) to filter error messages for the user.
EXPLOITATION
An attacker can trigger error page by sending requests with unsupported HTTP methods to existing endpoints. For example, using GET to /delete/{id} which uses specifically a DELETE (@DeleteMapping("/delete/{id}")). The leaked stack provides intelligence and sensitive data to the attacker.
CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges
Application connects to MySQL with root user account. Root user has typically full admin privileges iver the entire MySQL server, which is far more than the privileges required by this application that uses only one schema.
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
application.properties: spring.datasource.username=root 
EXPLOITATION
Although this spring boot project does not seem to have clear exploitation to sql injection . If a developer adds on the project @Query annotation  with native SQL or EntityManager.createNativeQuery() or JdbcTemplate with unsanitized input, there can be an SQL injection. Having root privileges makes the case even worse. The level of access goes beyond our schema, and lets the attacker:
•	Access, modify or delete data in other databases on the same MySQL server.
•	Create new databases.
•	Execute highly privileges methods, such as LOAD DATA INFILE.

 

A07:2021 Identification and Authentication Failures
CWE-798: Use of hard coded Credentials
Application contains sensitive user credentials (both admin and customer roles) in its source code.  If the attacker gains access to the source code, the credentials can be easily discovered and this could lead to unauthorized access: 
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
controller.LoginController.java: Hard coded admin credentials username=”admin”, password= “admin123” that are found on Line 40 and the hard coded customer username=”customer”, password=”cust123”, that can be found on Line 47.
EXPLOITATION
•	The attacker can used fuzzer to brute-force the /login endpoint (cluster bomb attack).
•	The POST http://localhost:8080/login was targeted, with role parameter as a fixed string “admin”.
•	For username and password, payloads were loaded from the SecLists repository https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists , specifically top-usernames-shortlist.txt for the usernames and Most-Popular-Letter-Passes.txt (modified) for the passwords.
•	Analysis of fuzzer results in ZAP, revealed 2 distinct response types: 
1.	Failed attempts: 200 OK status, body of 2162 bytes for login.html page, which means login failure.
2.	Successful attempts: 302 found status and size resp. body of 0 bytes. This pattern redirects to main page (/), and has no response body during the redirect.
Payload of username=admin and password=admin123 from the fuzzed lists were identified as successful. This showcase that the brute force attack successfully identified a valid admin username and password.
CWE-521: Weak Password Requitements and CWE: Use of Weak Credentials
Application does not force strong password during registration of user. This allows users to choose weak passwords, which make user accounts susceptible for brute force or attacks using dictionaries. The fact that username jim and password jim was acceptable, and the confirmation on mySQL database confirms this.
   
SOURCE CODE LOCATION
•	model.User.java: The password field (Line 14) does not have any validation annotations @Size, @Patterns, to force rules.
•	Controller.RegistrationController.java: The registerUser (Line 24) saves the User object without confirming any server-side password strength validation.
EXPLOITATION
The attacker can register new accounts with easy passwords, or target a any existed account with dictionary attacks or with brute force. The success of such registration with username jim and password jim demonstrates the vulnerability.

You can introduce your methodology and current progress with a short section before listing vulnerabilities, to clearly state how each vulnerability was found and what your next steps are. Here's a clear and professional paragraph you can insert before the Vulnerabilities section:

🔎 Methodology
The security assessment of the Shop application was conducted using a structured, multi-stage vulnerability discovery process, as advised by the COMP47910 module guidelines:

Manual exploitation was performed first on both the running application (localhost:8080) and the source code (IntelliJ project) connected to a local MySQL database, to directly identify exploitable weaknesses.

OWASP ZAP was subsequently used to detect additional alerts and confirm known issues through automated dynamic analysis.

Snyk will be used to detect known vulnerabilities in the project’s supply chain (dependencies) — this is planned for the next stage.

Authenticated scanning is currently available using a valid session and will be used in conjunction with ZAP to uncover vulnerabilities behind login-protected pages.

Finally, Large Language Models (LLMs) may be queried to identify any missing vulnerabilities or provide insights on edge cases that automated scanners or manual review might miss.

So far, all the vulnerabilities presented in this report have been manually discovered and validated by the author through direct interaction with the system’s functionality and its source code.

✅ Next Steps
To complete the assessment:

Conduct a ZAP authenticated scan using a logged-in session (admin and user accounts).

Run a Snyk scan to analyze the project’s Maven dependencies for CVEs.

Use an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) to ask about potential overlooked OWASP/CWE patterns based on the current application structure.

You can then proceed with the existing "Vulnerabilities" section.

Let me know if you'd like a paragraph for the final report conclusion summarizing findings and defenses.

The identification of vulnerabilities in the Shop web application followed a structured, multi-phase methodology as advised in the COMP47910 Secure Software Engineering 2025 guidelines. The process began with manual exploitation, conducted both against the running web application (http://localhost:8080) and by analyzing the source code within the IntelliJ IDE, connected to a local MySQL database. This allowed direct observation of exploitable weaknesses and validation of flawed logic and insecure configurations.

Following this, OWASP ZAP was employed to perform automated scanning and spidering, helping identify additional issues related to input validation, authentication, and security headers. The setup also supports authenticated scanning, using a valid login session to assess vulnerabilities behind the login-protected areas.

Additionally, Snyk will be utilized to evaluate the application’s software supply chain for vulnerabilities in its Maven dependencies. Lastly, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, will be consulted to help identify potential vulnerabilities or overlooked weaknesses that may not be detected through manual or automated means.

All vulnerabilities presented in this report so far have been discovered manually by the author through direct interaction with the system, its database, and source code.

Let me know if you want a version tailored to a more formal or academic writing style.

Είπες:
i want you to say 1,2,3,4 and use simplw words as manual scan, etc etc so i put as titles on each vulnerability
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Absolutely, here’s a simplified and structured introductory paragraph using numbered steps (1–4), aligned with the steps you followed. You can use these numbers later as labels/titles above each vulnerability (e.g., 1. Manual Scan, 2. ZAP Scan, etc.):

🔍 Vulnerability Discovery Process
To identify vulnerabilities in the Shop web application, the following four-step approach was used:

Manual Scan – First, I manually tested the application through the web interface (http://localhost:8080) and reviewed the Java source code in IntelliJ, while it was connected to a local MySQL database. This helped identify issues by simulating real user actions and analyzing how the backend handled them.

ZAP Scan – Next, I used the OWASP ZAP tool to perform automated scans and spidering. ZAP helped detect additional problems like missing security headers, brute-force opportunities, and weak validation. The ZAP setup also supports authenticated scanning, which I used to test pages after login.

Snyk Scan – I also plan to run Snyk to detect vulnerabilities in the application's dependencies (e.g., Maven libraries), especially those affecting the supply chain or involving known CVEs.

LLM Support – Finally, I will use a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT to ask about any vulnerabilities that might have been missed, or to get insights into weak areas in the design or code structure.

All vulnerabilities included in this report so far were discovered through Step 1: Manual Scan.

You can now prefix each vulnerability section with the method used. For example:

1. Manual Scan  
A01:2021 Broken Access Control  
CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Control Key  
...
Let me know if you'd like these labels auto-applied to all your existing vulnerabilities.

Είπες:
Snyk Scan is number 2. manual scan also contains zap, but on 3 there it is automated and authentication scan including spiders (all in zap) with the use of all number 1 tools.
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Thank you for the clarification. Based on your structure:

1 = Manual Scan (includes ZAP when used manually, source code, browser, etc.)

2 = Snyk Scan (supply chain analysis)

3 = Automated ZAP Scan (includes spider, active scan, and authenticated scan using session)

4 = LLM Assistance (for overlooked or undocumented vulnerabilities)

Here’s the updated, clear and structured paragraph with simple wording and consistent numbering, ready to precede your vulnerabilities section and guide your vulnerability titles:

🔍 Vulnerability Discovery Process
The discovery of vulnerabilities in the Shop web application followed a four-step approach, combining both manual techniques and automated tools:

Manual Scan – This was the first step and included hands-on testing of the running application (http://localhost:8080), manual inspection of the Java source code in IntelliJ, and review of the local MySQL database. It also involved using OWASP ZAP in manual mode (e.g., request interception, fuzzing, and response analysis) to identify and confirm vulnerabilities during normal use.

Snyk Scan – Snyk was used to analyze the Maven project dependencies for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) affecting the supply chain. This helped detect security issues introduced through external libraries or components.

Automated ZAP Scan – ZAP was also used in automated mode to run full scans, spider the application, and test authenticated areas using valid session cookies. This step extended the manual testing by automatically probing for vulnerabilities like injection points, missing headers, and brute-force risks.

LLM Support – A large language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, was used to identify any missing vulnerabilities or subtle issues not caught by the manual or automated steps. This step helped ensure a broader and more complete security review.

All vulnerabilities listed so far were discovered during Step 1: Manual Scan.

You can now label each vulnerability with a prefix like:

1. Manual Scan

2. Snyk Scan

3. Automated ZAP Scan

4. LLM Support

Let me know if you want me to go through your current report and add these prefixes consistently.

what should i say here?
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Based on your screenshot, the Snyk scan detected three high-severity vulnerabilities in your project’s dependencies, specifically in your pom.xml. One of the flagged issues is an Integer Overflow or Wraparound in the embedded Tomcat core library.

Here is a short and precise vulnerability entry you can include under 2. Snyk Scan in your report:

2. Snyk Scan
A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration
CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Vulnerability: Integer Overflow in org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core
Severity: High
Dependency Path:
spring-boot-starter-web@3.5.3 → tomcat-embed-core@10.1.42

🔍 Discovery
This vulnerability was identified using the Snyk IntelliJ plugin which scanned the project dependencies listed in pom.xml.

🛠 Description
The embedded Tomcat server is vulnerable to Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190), which can be triggered during file upload handling. A specially crafted HTTP multipart/form-data request with a malicious Content-Length header can exploit the overflow logic, potentially bypassing file size validation and causing memory exhaustion.

📄 Source
File: pom.xml

Module: org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core@10.1.42

✅ Recommended Fix
Upgrade tomcat-embed-core to a patched version such as 9.0.107, 10.1.43, or 11.0.9 (as suggested by Snyk Advisory).

Would you also like short entries for the other 2 vulnerabilities shown in your Snyk scan? I can help you write them up quickly.

Είπες:
it tells me on intelliJ ultimate on settings tools snyk, Connect ide to snykk, when i click it says we are now redirecting you to auth page, go again and login, although nothing happens, it has copy url button which does not copy anothing and cancel button
Το ChatGPT είπε:
You're experiencing a common issue with the Snyk IntelliJ plugin authentication flow, especially in IntelliJ Ultimate. Here’s how to fix or work around the “Connect IDE to Snyk” problem when the auth redirect doesn't work properly:

✅ Solution 1: Manually Authenticate via Browser
Click “Connect IDE to Snyk” in IntelliJ Settings > Tools > Snyk.

When the “Redirecting to auth page” popup appears, click “Copy URL” – even if it seems like nothing happens.

If copy doesn't work: press Ctrl+C immediately after clicking to manually grab the URL.

Alternatively: open the IntelliJ Event Log tab (bottom right), and look for a URL or warning message.

Paste the copied URL into your browser manually.

Log in with your Snyk account via GitHub or email.

After authentication, you’ll be redirected to a page that says something like:

“You may now return to IntelliJ”

Go back to IntelliJ — it should now say Connected.

✅ Solution 2: Use a Snyk Token (Alternative to GUI Auth)
If GUI authentication keeps failing:

Go to: https://app.snyk.io/account

Under "API Token", click “Reveal token” and copy it.

In IntelliJ:

Go to Settings > Tools > Snyk

Select “Use token”

Paste the API token and click Apply

🛠 Bonus Troubleshooting Tips
Check your IntelliJ firewall settings or VPN — the redirect might be blocked.

Ensure that you have JavaScript enabled in your browser.

Make sure IntelliJ is up to date.

Try launching IntelliJ as administrator/root.

Let me know if you want to proceed using the CLI-based Snyk scan as an alternative to the plugin. It’s fast and accurate for Maven projects.

Εικόνα που μεταφορτώθηκε
my intellij is tilted, and i can stop it with ctl alt delete
Το ChatGPT είπε:
It looks like your IntelliJ IDE window is stuck or "tilted" (possibly frozen or misrendered), and it only responds when you use Ctrl + Alt + Delete. This is likely due to a Java UI rendering issue, GPU conflict, or corrupted cache.

Here’s how you can fix IntelliJ's freezing/tilting issue safely:

✅ Step 1: Force Quit IntelliJ (if unresponsive)
Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete → Open Task Manager

Find IntelliJ IDEA or idea64.exe

Click End Task

✅ Step 2: Clear IntelliJ Cache (Safe)
Reopen IntelliJ with no project open (start screen).

Go to:

File > Invalidate Caches / Restart...
Select:

✅ Clear file system cache and local history

✅ Clear VCS log caches

Click Invalidate and Restart

✅ Step 3: Disable Hardware Acceleration (OpenGL issues)
If IntelliJ starts:

Go to: Help > Edit Custom VM Options

Add the following line at the end:

-Dsun.java2d.opengl=false
Save and restart IntelliJ.

This disables OpenGL rendering, which can fix display glitches like a “tilted” or unresponsive UI.

✅ Alternative (Safe Mode)
If IntelliJ is still broken:

Run IntelliJ in Safe Mode:

Hold Shift while starting IntelliJ.

Select “Disable all plugins”.

Then gradually re-enable only what you need.

🛠 Optional: Reinstall Snyk Plugin
Sometimes Snyk plugin hangs the UI. After recovery:

Go to Settings > Plugins

Search for “Snyk”

Uninstall and reinstall it (latest version).

Let me know if you'd like to run Snyk via CLI (snyk test) as a backup while IntelliJ is recovering.

after i invalidated caches look at what i see. intellij opened and after snyk tested file for vulnerabilities this happened
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Thanks for the screenshot — it's a blank white screen, which suggests IntelliJ has launched but the UI is frozen, unrendered, or glitched, likely due to a graphics rendering issue, especially after Snyk triggered a scan.

This is a known issue on some systems (especially with Windows + Java FX + GPU rendering). Here's how to fix it permanently:

✅ Step-by-Step Fix for IntelliJ White/Blank Screen
🔧 Option 1: Disable GPU Rendering (Recommended Fix)
Close IntelliJ completely (Ctrl + Alt + Delete > Task Manager > End Task).

Navigate to IntelliJ configuration folder:

C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.IntelliJIDEA<version>\config
For example:

C:\Users\jimbo\.IntelliJIDEA2024.1\config
Open or create a file named:

idea.properties
Add this line at the end:

sun.java2d.opengl=false
or even better:

-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false
-Dsun.java2d.opengl=false
Save the file.

Reopen IntelliJ. It should now render without GPU acceleration.

🧪 Option 2: Launch IntelliJ in Safe Mode
If you want to test whether the Snyk plugin is causing this:

Hold Shift while launching IntelliJ.

Select "Disable all downloaded plugins".

If it opens fine, then Snyk plugin is the cause. You can then:

Uninstall Snyk from Settings > Plugins.

Reinstall later or use CLI instead (snyk test).

✅ Option 3: Run IntelliJ with a Custom VM Option
Go to:

Help > Edit Custom VM Options
Add this line at the end:

-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false
Save and restart IntelliJ.

🛠 If All Else Fails: Reset IntelliJ Settings
You can reset the IDE completely by deleting the config folder:

C:\Users\<YourName>\.IntelliJIDEA<version>\
Delete (or rename) the folder and relaunch. You will lose custom settings, but plugins and cache will be rebuilt from scratch.

Let me know if you want to run Snyk from the command line (CLI) instead — it bypasses IntelliJ entirely and is very reliable.

Είπες:
Εικόνα που μεταφορτώθηκε
 which one is it?
Το ChatGPT είπε:
To locate and reset IntelliJ's configuration and cache files, you need to open the right hidden directory. Based on your screenshot, you're looking in C:\Users\Dimitrios Kyriakidis, which is correct.

Here’s where IntelliJ stores its config, system, and cache folders:

🔍 You’re Looking For:
.IntelliJIDEA<version> folder
This folder holds IDE settings and cache. Example names:

.IntelliJIDEA2024.1

.IntelliJIDEA2023.3

.IntelliJIdea<UltimateVersion>

🔍 This folder is likely hidden, so to make it visible:

In File Explorer, click on the "Προβολή" (View) tab.

Check "Κρυφά στοιχεία" (Hidden items).

Look again under C:\Users\Dimitrios Kyriakidis — the .IntelliJIDEA folder should now appear.

✅ Reset IntelliJ Settings
Once you locate the .IntelliJIDEA<version> folder:

Rename it to something like:

.IntelliJIDEA2024.1_backup
Restart IntelliJ. It will recreate a fresh default config.

You can later move back specific files (e.g., keymaps or installed plugins) if needed.

Let me know once you've found the folder — or if you'd prefer to clean just the plugin folder or logs first.

Είπες:
i can see hidden folders and files like i see appdata folder here, although there is no hidden .intelliJ...
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Thanks for confirming. If the .IntelliJIDEA<version> folder isn't visible even with hidden items shown, it's likely stored under IntelliJ's JetBrains-specific folder inside AppData, not directly in your home folder.

✅ Try These Folders Instead:
1. Main IntelliJ config and cache folders:
Folder	Path
Config	C:\Users\Dimitrios Kyriakidis\AppData\Roaming\JetBrains\IntelliJIdea2024.1
Caches	C:\Users\Dimitrios Kyriakidis\AppData\Local\JetBrains\IntelliJIdea2024.1
⚠️ Replace 2024.1 with your actual IntelliJ version (e.g., 2023.3, 2023.2, etc.).

🧹 How to Fully Reset IntelliJ:
Close IntelliJ completely.

Go to:

C:\Users\Dimitrios Kyriakidis\AppData\Roaming\JetBrains\
→ Find the folder IntelliJIdea2024.1 or similar → Rename it (e.g., IntelliJIdea2024.1_backup)

Then go to:

C:\Users\Dimitrios Kyriakidis\AppData\Local\JetBrains\
→ Again, rename the IntelliJIdea2024.1 folder.

Now reopen IntelliJ — it will start as if freshly installed (you won't lose your code, only settings/plugins).

💡 Optional: Keep Projects Safe
Your actual Java/Maven project files are safe (in folders like IdeaProjects/ or Assignment2/). Resetting IntelliJ settings does not delete your project source code.

Let me know what version IntelliJ you're using if you're unsure which folder to delete. I’ll give the exact name.

Είπες:
2025.1.3 is my intellij
Το ChatGPT είπε:
Great — since you're using IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1.3, the correct folders to reset are:

✅ IntelliJ Config & Cache Folders for 2025.1.3
Type	Location
Config	C:\Users\Dimitrios Kyriakidis\AppData\Roaming\JetBrains\IntelliJIdea2025.1
Caches	C:\Users\Dimitrios Kyriakidis\AppData\Local\JetBrains\IntelliJIdea2025.1
🧹 Reset Instructions
Close IntelliJ completely (Ctrl + Alt + Delete → End task if needed).

Navigate to:

C:\Users\Dimitrios Kyriakidis\AppData\Roaming\JetBrains\
→ Find IntelliJIdea2025.1 → Right-click → Rename to IntelliJIdea2025.1_backup

Then go to:

C:\Users\Dimitrios Kyriakidis\AppData\Local\JetBrains\
→ Find IntelliJIdea2025.1 → Rename to IntelliJIdea2025.1_backup

Restart IntelliJ. It will now recreate fresh configuration files. You’ll be prompted like it's a fresh install.

✅ Safe: Your Code Is Unaffected
This does not delete your projects, which are in folders like IdeaProjects, Assignment2, etc.

Let me know when it boots again — or if you want to reconfigure Snyk plugin from scratch after reset.

Το ChatGPT είπε:
Thanks for the update — you're now seeing the "Authenticating Snyk Plugin" dialog, but it's not opening the browser window automatically — a known bug in some IntelliJ versions + dark theme + recent Snyk plugin builds.

Here’s exactly what you should do:

✅ How to Authenticate Snyk When Browser Doesn't Open
Click the “Copy URL” button in the dialog
(If it doesn’t copy: try Ctrl+C while the button is focused)

Open any browser manually (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

Paste the URL manually into the browser's address bar
If the copy button fails to work, open IntelliJ's Event Log (bottom right) — the URL may be logged there.

The browser should take you to a Snyk login page. Log in via GitHub or your email.

Once logged in, you'll see a message like:

✅ You can now return to IntelliJ

Go back to IntelliJ → the Snyk plugin will now say “Connected”.

🔧 If the “Copy URL” Button Fails
If clicking Copy URL does nothing, here’s a workaround:

A. Open IntelliJ’s Event Log:
Click bottom-right corner of IntelliJ → Event Log

Look for something like:

Opening browser for authentication...
https://app.snyk.io/login?token=...
Copy that full URL manually from the Event Log and paste it in your browser.

🛠 Optional: Use Snyk Token Instead (No OAuth)
Go to: https://app.snyk.io/account

Copy your API Token

In IntelliJ → Settings > Tools > Snyk

Switch to Token authentication method

Paste the token, click Apply → OK

This bypasses the whole browser issue.

Let me know which route works — and I can help you verify scan results next.

You're almost there — the Snyk authentication via OAuth worked in the browser, but IntelliJ didn't recognize it and still shows “Connect IDE to Snyk”.

This is a known bug in some IntelliJ versions and Snyk plugin builds, especially after cache resets. Here's how to resolve it:

✅ Fix: Use Your Snyk Token Instead of OAuth
Since OAuth completed successfully, just switch to token-based authentication, which is stable and immediate.

Step-by-Step:
Go to https://app.snyk.io/account

Scroll to the "API Token" section

Click “Reveal Token” and copy it

Back in IntelliJ:

Go to Settings > Tools > Snyk

Change Authentication method to Token

Paste your token into the Token field

Leave “Organization” blank or type your Snyk org name if you have one

Click Apply, then OK

Wait a few seconds and open the Snyk tool window (bottom panel or View > Tool Windows > Snyk)

It should now start scanning your project

You’ll see vulnerabilities appear if pom.xml or other files have issues

🧼 Optional: Clean Up Stuck OAuth Cache (if you want OAuth to work again)
If you're determined to fix OAuth instead:

Close IntelliJ

Delete this folder:

C:\Users\Dimitrios Kyriakidis\.snyk-ide
Reopen IntelliJ and try OAuth from scratch

But using the API token is faster, more stable, and recommended unless SSO is enforced.

Let me know once your scan runs successfully, and I can help summarize the new Snyk findings in CWE/OWASP format for your assignment.

You're exactly where you need to be. To authenticate IntelliJ with a token, follow these steps:

✅ How to Copy the Snyk Token and Use It in IntelliJ
In the "Auth Token" section:

Click the "click to show" link under KEY

It will reveal your API token

Copy that token (right-click > Copy or Ctrl + C)

Open IntelliJ IDEA

Go to Settings (File > Settings on Windows)
→ Navigate to Tools > Snyk

Under Authentication method, choose: Token

Paste the copied token into the Token field

You can leave Organization as jimboy3100 (as shown on your Snyk dashboard) or leave it empty

Click Apply, then OK

Open the Snyk tool window in IntelliJ:

View > Tool Windows > Snyk

Or click the Snyk tab at the bottom

Click “Test project” or wait for it to scan

Once you’ve done this, Snyk should be fully connected and scanning your code and dependencies. Let me know when you're in — and I can help you interpret new findings for your assignment.
